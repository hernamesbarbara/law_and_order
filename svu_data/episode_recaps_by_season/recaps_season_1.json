      "corpus": "Cragen enters the squad room telling the team that One Police Plaza has decided to have biyearly psych evaluations. To pilot the program, SVU will be the guinea pig. He hands them each a folder, tells them to fill it out, and the resident psychologist will set up the appointments. After Cragen tells them he does not know where they are going with this, Benson asks who is first. He tells them he will be first. When Stabler asks Benson if she believes this, she tells him they may need it. The Romanian owner of a fruit stand on Lex and 78th interrupts them to report a sex crime. He explains that after two boys steal bananas from him, a woman begs him to help her. She is trapped in a situation with a man she cannot escape. He believes there is both physical and sexual abuse. He tells them he does not know her name or address, but she hands him a piece of paper with the name \"Constanta Condrescu\" and asks him to tell her she was right that she needs help before taking off. When Stabler asks what time this happened, he tells him three days ago.While the fruit vendor works with a sketch artist, Cragen tries to understand the case. Some girl is being abused by some guy somewhere in Manhattan. Stabler explains Mircha, the fruit vendor, came to the states a few years ago and he has never been in trouble. Benson tells them he accidentally told his wife about it and she would not shut up until he came in. Benson reminds Cragen many women are abused by their other half and never report it so they at least need to investigate. Munch agrees giving a comparison to \"Deep Throat.\"Benson and Stabler shows Constanta the sketch and ask if she knows her. When she denies it, Stabler reminds her how rare her name is. She finally admits the girl is Ilena, her niece. Ilena came to the states three years prior on a student visa and she has not seen her since. She tells them she does not know where she is. Before they leave, Benson gives Constanta her card and asks her to call if she can think of anything else. As they make their way to the car, Stabler calls in for a check on Ilena after telling Benson they at least found out her name and got an actual picture. When Stabler says unless Ilena flunked out or quit she should still be at NYU, Benson calls Munch to have him check with NYU.Munch is told Ilena never showed up at NYU. When he asks if they have the reason why in her file, he is shown the file room of student records. Audrey Jackson closes the blinds to the room she is using for the evaluations. Cragen tells her he feels like a prep. When they take their seats, she asks him about golf and what he does to relax. He gets fed up with the dance and tells her to go ahead and ask him about his alcoholism. He tells her he gets the urge to drink after what he sees every day. When Jackson asks if he will drink, he tells her to ask him tomorrow and walks out.When Benson and Stabler show Ilena's picture to a clown in the park amking balloons, he tells them he sees her all the time. He informs them she has gained some weight since the picture, but he is positive it is her. She is the nanny of an eight or nine year old. He last saw her the day prior.When Benson and Stabler inform Cragen the clown saw her serene the day before, Cragen tries to make sense of it. Three days prior she is slipping an S.O.S. to a fruit vendor and a few days later she is strolling happily through the park with a kid. While Stabler answers his ringing phone, Cragen explains he wants Ilena in the station explaining herself after wasting 32 combined man-hours. Stabler announces Homicide caught a dump job off the Henry Hudson with Benson's card in the pocket.When Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene, they are told the body was wrapped in a rug and probably dumped the previous night. There are no witnesses because people always dump stuff. She was found by a fisherman thinking he found a present for his wife. When they see the body, they confirm her identity as Constanta Condrescu. Stabler guesses she found a way to contact Ilena.The ME informs Benson and Stabler Constanta was dead before she was put on the rug. Something injected into her bloodstream caused her heart to stop beating instantly without effecting the other organs, but he cannot find a puncture wound. After explaining he checked all of the usual concealed places, Benson asks if he checked under the tongue. As he is telling her that would make sense for an accidental overdose but not for a killer, he checks and finds the puncture wound.During the team meeting, Stabler suggests the victim had to be sedated for the killer to inject at that location. Cragen does not understand Constanta sharing a spiked drink with the perp after learning Ilena is in trouble. Stabler guesses she did since she was dead two hours after they left her. Munch tells them Ilena's father was murdered in Romania in '89 and believes the two are linked. Cragen tells him to start the investigation in Murray Hill.As the team searches Constanta's home, Benson finds an unfinished cup of tea. Stabler finds her address book opened to the Cs with a page missing. Munch and Jefferies inform them the neighbors did not know her and they never saw the niece. Benson hands them a shoe box and tells them they may have better luck with her work.At the restaurant, Jeffries is told Ilena never came there. Constanta was saving to bring Ilena from Romania, but Ilena met a businessman who agreed to help. He used his frequent flyer miles for her ticket and told her of a part-time job. Constanta tried to tell Ilena there would be a catch. She tried to contact her through the man, but he told her he had not heard from her. She kept trying before finally giving up.During Benson's evaluation, she tells Jackson she is the child of rape. Although sometimes she gets too close to a case, she never loses her objectivity. When Jackson asks about her use of deadly force, Benson tells her Stabler was about to be shot and reacted as she was trained. Benson does not answer when Jackson asks her what she would do if she could not work sex crimes.When Benson arrives at the lab, Stabler asks how it went with Jackson. After she responds it was a cakewalk, he looks at her as if he doubts the accuracy of her answer. They are told the rug is a Persian Keshan costing about $5000. She found dirt, cotton fibers, and a hair with an intact root that does not belong to the victim. Although they cannot prove it is the prep's, they still desire a perp to compare it to.Munch and Jeffries check Air Bucharest for Ilena's flight information. When a phone starts ringing, Munch tells the man not to answer it before he is informed it is his phone. While Munch is on the phone, Jefferies suggests they check flights from Romania to JFK. They find the frequent flyer is Randolph Morrow.When Benson and Stabler are knocking at the front door of the Morrow residence, Ilena comes out another door on the ground. When they tell her they got her message to her aunt, she claims she does not know what they are talking about. After a little girl runs up to Ilena, they move the conversation inside. She tells them the Morrows are good to her. She informs them they are at work and she must have dinner ready by the time they get home. Benson informs her that her aunt was murdered an hour after they told her she was in trouble. Ilena tells them she never sent the message. Stabler tells her they know her aunt came to see her. Ilena claims she has not seen her aunt in three years and repeats she has to have dinner ready when they get home. Before they leave, Stabler offers his condolences. Benson asks her why she never started at NYU causing the door to shut in their faces.When Benson and Stabler inform the team the only time Ilena showed any emotion was at the thought of dinner being late, Jackson tells them it is the Stockholm Syndrome. After Jackson and Munch fill them in on what they are talking about, Jackson informs them it only takes 72 hours to break down a person's psyche through threats of death, isolation, and random acts of kindness. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to find out what is going on in that house.During Munch's evaluation, Jackson asks if he dates and if working in the unit effects his ability to function sexually. After joking his way through, he tells her he has a hard time talking about himself and asks what she thinks. She notes his multiple marriages to beautiful, spoiled women saying none of them matched him intellectually. She tells him he does not trust women or the government and he can smell a conspiracy at a five year old's lemonade stand. She adds he has given up on relationships, but believes in true love and the pain of never having found it is unbearable.Benson and Stabler walk with the Morrows' neighbors as they walk their dog. They believe the Morrows are good neighbors and decent parents. When Benson asks about Ilena, they are told she has been with them for one year. They tell them Mrs. Morrow is a veterinarian and Mr. Morrow is an investment banker.Randolph Morrow tells Benson and Stabler Ilena told him about her aunt but denies ever meeting her or knowing she was around. He informs them he met Ilena while on a business trip to Romania. She wanted to come to the states and he needed a nanny so he brought her back with him three years ago. While Benson tells him his neighbors are positive Ilena has only been here a year and he reminds her it is New York, his secretary brings in some drinks only to have him order her to lower the blinds. Before they leave, he tells them he was in a meeting with four corporate lawyers on Monday between four and six. As they leave, Benson notices hairs on his jacket. Acting as if she is just being nice, she plucks a few. Once outside, Stabler compliments her on her method of collecting DNA. Stabler receives a call telling them Constanta was killed with Beuthanasia. He clarifies the drug is used to put animals to sleep.Dr. Morrow tells Benson and Stabler she was at home on Monday. She tells them her husband was not there and denies Ilena had any visitors. After Dr. Morrow asks Barry to help her, Stabler asks how things are working out with Ilena. While she retrieves a pill from the medicine cabinet she tells him they have a routine, but her husband can explain it better. Stabler asks her if she and Ilena got along when she has to retrieve the pill she dropped. She tells him her husband selected her to help her. Dr. Morrow tells them they should talk to her husband when Benson asks how close he and Ilena are. They are interrupted by news of a hit-and-run accident. She asks Barry to take over for her before excusing herself. When Stabler compliments the facility, Barry tells them they have their own O.R., recovery rooms, and a pharmacy down the hall. He explains the DEA does not monitor them as closely as they do humans. When they ask about vets getting addicted, Barry ends the conversation. Stabler gives him his card and tells him to call if he wants to tell them anything else.During Jeffries's evaluation, Jackson asks about her close call with the explosion. Jeffries explains she does not hesitate, but is more confident saying she feels alive. She tells her she was in a long-term relationship before starting with the unit and has been celibate until the accident. She tells her she goes out with a lot of men. After hesitating, she decides to tell her about meeting a former suspect in a bar and going home with him. Munch sees Jeffries and asks if she is okay because Jackson had him wanting to eat his gun. She unconvincingly tells him she is fine before walking off. When Barry asks Munch for Benson or Stabler, he escorts him to them.Barry explains when Valium or Ketamine come up missing it is normal because of the stress. He tells them Dr. Morrow took Beuthanasia home a few months ago. He explains you cannot mistake it because it is bright pink.Dr. Morrow tells Benson and Stabler the Beuthanasia was for her personal use. When Benson asks if she wanted the drug because her husband was sleeping with Ilena, she tells her sexuality is about reaching our limits and transcending them. Stabler asks if her husband transcended Ilena's aunt. She tells them Constanta showed up at her door, threatened her husband, and threatened her routine so she calmed her down with tea. She tells them her husband did not have to tell her to kill Constanta.After they receive no response from pounding on the Morrows' door, Benson and Stabler break the glass to gain entry. Once inside, they smell something coming from upstairs. When they reach the room, they see Morrow burning pictures. Stabler cuffs him while Benson tries to salvage as many pictures as possible. Morrow tells Stabler Ilena is gone for good. Not believing him, Stabler and Benson begin searching the house calling her name. When they find a door with a padlock, they break it open and reveal a restraint system.In the interrogation room, Benson asks Morrow where the girl in the picture is. He tells her he would like a mineral water without ice. She responds she would like his balls in a blender. When he tells her he would like some quiet time, she excuses herself to catch up on some typing. Once she is out of the room, Stabler tells him he should not have called her \"honey.\" When Stabler tells him he has been trying to break her in, Morrow suggests the excruciatingly painful rack. He adds it has to be consensual like it is with Ilena. Cragen interrupts them escorting Morrow's attorney. When the attorney gets upset about Stabler questioning his client, Morrow tells him they were discussing common interests. Cragen stops Stabler to let him know the hair from the rug belongs to Dr. Morrow. Stabler returns to the squad room telling Benson they need the warrant now because they need to find Ilena before she dies.ADA Alden explains to the judge the detectives entered the apartment believing a woman was in imminent danger when they saw the pictures. She tells him they found evidence she was being held against her will and recently moved. The judge reminds her of the amount of bondagfe shops in the city stating possession does not mean it was non-consensual. He denies the warrant. Benson and Stabler locate Dr. Morrow in the hospital de-toxing from Ketamine after long-term use. When they suggest her husband tortured Ilena, she corrects them saying he disciplined her. They tell her Ilena is missing and the only one left to put in the closet is their adopted daughter. She explains he was good to her at first, but he began asking her to do things. She did not leave because she was afraid for their daughter. Nothing changed until Ilena came. He kept Ilena in the closet for the first six months unless he was torturing or raping her. She never helped Ilena because he stopped hurting her. Stabler tells her she is going to help them.Stabler informs Munch it was easy to get Dr. Morrow to flip on Morrow. When he tells Stabler and Munch she will not testify, Stabler tells him they control her now. They explain he made her too pliable making it easy for them to gain control. He tells them he controls Ilena. Stabler makes him stand up and sit back down a few times before telling him they have forced every move he has made. He denies it. When Stabler tells him they forced him to move Ilena, Morrow grins causing Stabler to go back to the squad room where Benson and Jeffries were looking over the photos. Benson confirms all of the pictures were taken in the house, but they cannot figure out one with a corner of a rug. They realize the rug was the one Constanta was wrapped in so Stabler checks Dr. Morrow's confession and finds it was taken from the bedroom. They rush out the door to find her.When they arrive in the bedroom, Benson and Stabler check under the mattress then pound around the bottom checking for a hollow sound. Stabler pulls some pieces of wood off and they remove the sheet of wood. They pull out a vented wood box and find Ilena struggling to breathe. Stabler calls for an ambulance as Benson helps her out. She begs them to tell him she did not make a sound.In Stabler's evaluation, Jackson asks how long a case like this sticks with him. He tells her a while, but he hugs his kids and kisses his wife to help him deal with it. He explains he does not want to be his families window into the world he deals with every day. When she asks if the cases involving children hits too close to home, he tells her he has seen a soulless child. He handles it by thinking about the crime, the victim, the perps, and how he could get away with killing them.Jackson informs Cragen she has seen everyone and most of what she has seen is normal. She explains the program's purpose is to identify detectives close to a meltdown. She tells him she has found some at that level and she has to recommend they be removed from duty immediately. Cragen asks, \"Who?\""

      "corpus": "When pictures of a little boy are developed, Benson and Stabler are called. They are told the pictures were dropped off by Larry Holt 45 minutes earlier. After seeing an open bottle of alcohol in one of the pictures, Benson believes the only charge will be Endangering the Welfare of a Child. They decide they will follow him for a few weeks, but Holt arrives to pick up his pictures so they arrest him.Cragen looks at the pictures and tells Benson and Stabler they do not even have Holt on Endangering because they cannot prove the liquid in the bottle was not apple juice. Stabler points out the boy's shorts were too short and he had to be told to drop his chin. When Cragen suggests he could be in the pageant circuit, Stabler reminds him boys do not usually go Jonbenet. Stabler tells him guys that take those kinds of pictures are going to keep them. Benson informs ADA Hickey that Holt is the boy's piano teacher. Stabler believes there are more pictures and he wants a warrant to search Holt's home. Holt's attorney interrupts them because Holt told him they took his keys and wallet. Cragen tells him they voucher all personal property for safe keeping. When the attorney asks for Holt's keys, Cragen asks why he needs them. He claims he needs to feed the dog, but Cragen tells him the dog will be fine before finally telling him the Property Clerk has them. Once he is gone, Benson removes a brown envelope from her desk containing the items in question. Cragen tells them he will put a uniform at Holt's door. Hickey tells them if they get probable cause, they will have their warrant. Benson and Stabler head out to the small neighborhood.When Benson and Stabler arrive at Holt's, they see the uniform officer trying to explain to Holt's son that no one is allowed inside. Stabler explains they have a warrant pending in front of a judge and the premises will remain locked down until she rules. He accepts this and leaves. They question why a rich, white man would move into this neighborhood across from an elementary school. When a little boy runs up to them and tries to get past them, they stop him. He explains he has piano lessons when they ask him where he is going. Stabler compares the picture of the little boy to the boy standing before him and realizes they are the same one.In the interview room, Jonathan tells Benson that Holt puts his hand on his back while he plays for posture. When he tells her his dad told him the touching was okay, his father informs her that is the way Holt teaches the kids in the neighborhood. Jonathan tells her Holt has taken pictures of him while he played, but he found some snappies of naked boys when he turned a sheet of music. From the other side of the one-way, Hickey tells Stabler and Cragen they now have their probable cause and he will call in a favor with Judge Rothman. Cragen tells Stabler to go with Hickey and they will go in while the ink is still drying.After Rothman signs the warrant including all forms of media, Stabler calls Benson to tell them they can go in. While Benson looks through a chest of sheet music, she locates a photo album containing pictures of boys at various stages of undress. As Munch looks around, he notices a disguised door and forces it open. He makes his way to the television and VCR and starts the tape. As he is watching, Benson and Jeffries make their way in the room to see Holt abusing a boy as he plays piano. The tape is turned off and the lights are turned on revealing shelves full of videos.    In court, the judge verifies 43 photos in the album were obscene and 157 tapes were found. He charges Holt with Endangering the Welfare of a Child, Use of a Child in a Sexual Performance, Promoting an Obscene Sexual Performance by a Child, and 44 counts of Possessing Obscene Sexual Performance by a Child. When Holt's attorney reminds the judge the prosecution has not had time to inventory all of the cassette tapes, the judge tells him they will all dread the discovery process before denying bail.The team gathers in front of the television and VCR to view the tape found in Holt's VCR. They believe they are watching different children until the boy rubs his eyebrow in each segment after the first causing them to realize it is the same boy suffering from thirteen years of abuse. Stabler stops the tape as Hickey arrives. Cragen reminds him they usually hear about the abuse after it happens. Benson adds to see it is different. Munch volunteers to watch the remaining tapes. Cragen tells Hickey they need Holt's computer, day planner, and his schedule. Hickey tells them that in order to get Holt on abuse they need a kid. Cragen specifies they need the kid on the tape.Seven detectives armed with pictures of the kid on the tape knock on doors in the neighborhood asking if anyone knows him. Time after time, they are told they should ask Holt. The clerk at the store tells Stabler Holt is fruity touching everyone and everything. The clerk at the video store tells Jeffries his kids get free lessons and tell him Holt is strict. He tells her Holt taught Rey Guzimano. He believes Holt makes more of a difference in people's lives than she will.Jeffries believes the people know. Stabler thinks they were trying to be optimistic. Benson suggests they were too busy trying to survive. When Jeffries leaves to speak with someone, Benson tries to read his mind saying even the best parents cannot protect their kids. He tells her he was thinking he ha a gutter that needs to be fixed, but continues saying parents wish they could feel all of the pain for their kids. When Benson questions why have them at all, he explains you want them more than anything and you want to love them every day. When they arrive in front of Holt's home, they hear someone playing piano. They find Evan oblivious to their presence finishing a piece. When they gain his attention, he informs them he has keys. After they compliment his playing, they show him the picture from the video. While he looks at the picture, he rubs his eyebrow causing them to realize they found the kid in the video.In the interview, Evan tells Benson and Stabler he has an audition for Julliard thanks to Holt. Holt pushed him by making him practice. He would set the bar higher and each time Evan made it. Evan denies Holt ever hurt him.When Stabler tells Cragen and Hickey Evan did not know he was video taped, Cragen suggests showing him the tape. Stabler warns him there will be more pain for Evan if they do. He questions if the currents charges against Holt will be enough. Hickey tells him Holt will only get seven years. Stabler warns them again that viewing the tape will ruin Evan's life. Cragen reminds him Evan is an adult before leaving with Hickey to show Evan the tape.Cragen warns Evan what he will see on the tape is wrong, but they need the other person on the tape to help them. When Evan sees the video, he asks them to turn it off and backs into the corner before turning around and crying into the wall. Cragen tries to comfort him when he slides down to the floor. Stabler opens the door and looks at Cragen.As Benson and Stabler approach Evan's home, they discuss Holt's characteristics of being rich, white, and educated caused the kids to want to be a part of his world where he can love them. When they tell Evan's mother they want to speak with him about playing piano, she tells them if they are from the school then they need to talk to him about who is going to pay for it. In the kitchen, they ask him to help with the identities of the kids in the other pictures in the photo album. He tells them Holt's cabinet doors close unlike his own. The middle school's piano is missing a D-Flat and is always out of tune while Holt's is nice. He tells them there is a price to pay for everything. Benson asks again for help with the pictures. He tells them Holt cared about him and bought him a coat one year. When he informs them Rey Guzimano made his first CD at 17, Benson reminds him Julliard accepted a 41-year-old flute player the year before. He reminds her the guy was a monk. He grabs the album and turns to a picture identifying the boy as Caesar. He is in jail because his gun accidentally went off when a dry cleaner was opening the register. He turns to another picture identifying him as Ricky, who is currently a junkie. He locates another picture identifying him as Tony and no one knows where he is.Jeffries informs the team Holt did not have a computer, a day planner, or a set schedule. Cragen clarifies there is no evidence anyone helped Holt. When Hickey reminds them the tapes have dates on them, Stabler clarifies the dates are the beginning of the lessons. Jeffries informs them the current students and their families are not talking. Hickey informs them the case is being fast-tracked and Evan's two counts of abuse are being tried separately. Cragen and Hickey explain the change in the law in 1996 did not come with a grandfather clause and abuse can only be prosecuted until the age of 23, but everything before 1996 is inadmissible and anything after the age of 17 is consensual. Stabler informs them Evan does not want to betray Holt and worries people will hate him. When Cragen suggests they talk with the kids Evan knows, Stabler tells him Caesar the lifer or Ricky the junkie making him realize it would not help.Ricky tells Benson Holt never touched him. He quit playing because he did not have technique or discipline. He tells her if Holt's door was ever locked, they could come back for a meal, sugar cookie, and warmth. Guzimano tells Jeffries he does not owe the community anything. Holt was the only one who ever told him he could do anything. There are only three ways to get out of the neighborhood: smart enough to figure it out, get out on your own, or you are good at something. Holt's son tells Stabler he will not talk to him because Holt is his father. Cragen finds Munch still in front of the television. Munch tells him every time he closes his eyes he sees every frame of the tapes. Cragen tells him to go home. Munch contemplates the better part of Homicide...bodies that do not talk back. Cragen reminds him of his attempt to retire from Baltimore only to end up in another squad room in New York. When he says he will do a better job of quitting this time, Cragen believes he is running and sends him home again. Munch tells him he has two more tapes to watch. While Stabler reads 'Twas the Night Before Christmas with Dickie and Lizzie, Dickie questions if their stockings will be filled. As Stabler checks his beeping pager, he explains Christmas comes once a year and it is now February. He asks Lizzie to hand him the phone. She hands it to him as they ask why Christmas cannot come all the time. He dials the number saying Santa's credit cards are maxed out. He tells Evan to stay put and he will be there as soon as he can.Evan tells Stabler his mother kicked him out because she thinks he is gay. Stabler explains he knows places that will help him get on his feet. When he asks about his job, Evan tells him washing dishes damaged his hands, but he was fired. After Evan tells him he wants to testify, he asks if Stabler thinks he is gay. Stabler explains he probably does not know yet. It is not something you choose. When he is ready, he will see someone with love.Stabler closes the piano startling Kathy. When she asks him what is going on at work, he tells her nothing. She asks him if he talked to Benson about it. He reminds her that Benson is his partner.Stabler asks Hickey how to make Evan more comfortable in the courtroom. Hickey tells him Evan answers questions like a kid trying to find the right answer. Stabler reminds him Evan shut down at 8-years-old. Hickey suggests they give Evan a tour of the courtroom. After Evan spins around in the judge's chair and bangs the gavel, they have him sit on the witness stand. Hickey explains he will not be allowed in the courtroom because his testimony may become contaminated. He tells him to look at only him and answer the questions as they practiced. When Holt's lawyer asks him questions, he is to answer them and ignore everything else.When Stabler returns to the squad room, Munch asks if Holt made a conscious choice or if he was abused. Stabler tells him it is just another excuse. Holt hurt a lot of kids and that is his concern. Munch tells him he has something to show him. They end up in front of the television with a video of Evan and Jonathan. When Holt comes in and tells Evan Jonathan is ready, Stabler sits down and continues watching in anger as Evan abuses Jonathan.Jeffries believes Evan has been through enough. Benson reminds her that in this case Evan is the abuser. Munch tells them Evan is both. Cragen wonders who is next stating if Evan hurts another kid then they are responsible. Benson tells them in a few years Evan will be Holt. Cragen calls Hickey to come over after telling them the same laws apply to Evan as they do to Holt.Evan explains Holt told him if Jonathan had never felt longing then he could not play a piece about longing. When Stabler tells him Jonathan was playing The Entertainer, Evan responds that was how he was taught. He promises it only happened once. When he is told he committed a crime, he tells them he deserves to be punished. Cragen tells him they may be able to work out a deal. As Cragen and Stabler leave the interrogation room, Cragen asks him if he thinks they should not make a deal with Evan. Cragen explains they are stuck in the middle. When he reminds Stabler they watched him be subjected to horrible things, Stabler questions if he is talking about Jonathan or Evan successfully proving his point. Stabler believes the abuse Evan suffered relieves him of too much responsibility because he made the choice to commit a crime. Cragen theorizes Stabler is being eaten up because of the lack of choice the little boy Evan had.In court, the judge sets bail at $25,000 causing a side bar. When they explain Evan is a key witness in their case against Holt and the stress of a night in jail may effect his testimony, the judge releases him into the custody of the people until his testimony is complete.   In the hotel room, Stabler tells Evan he does not hate him, but when he looks at him instead of seeing the victim he sees the abuser. While he is unpacking, he pulls out the book he and the twins were reading and throws it on the bed. When Evan picks it up and starts reading it, Stabler takes it away.In court, Evan tells them Holt would sit next to him on the piano bench and touch his back for posture. When Hickey asks if Holt ever touched him anywhere else, Evan answered in the affirmative.At the sentencing hearing, the judge asks if Holt would like to say anything. When he does not, she tells him she sees nothing that tells her he is remorseful after having stolen the hope from the children. She sentences him to 115 years. Hickey tells Evan Holt will be eligible for parole in thirty years.Hickey, Stabler, and Cragen try to explain Evan's deal to Jonathan's father. They want to spare Jonathan from being on the stand. Evan will be on heavily supervised probation. Jonathan's father threatens to take the story to the media if they keep the deal.Evan hands Stabler the envelope from Julliard. Stabler feels the weight and congratulates him. Hickey informs Evan and his lawyer the judge will not accept the deal. Hickey tells Evan a felony carries one to three years in jail. His lawyer believes he will get probation if they go to trial and withdraws the guilty plea. Evan does not want Jonathan to have to go to court. He tells them he does not know why Holt is the way he is, but he knows why he is the way he is and he wants the cycle to stop now."

      "corpus": "Sarah Logan, a field reporter on the news, tells her audience of being raped. She tells them the police have been working her case for 12 weeks with no leads. She asks for their help. She describes one as having a tattoo of a star on his wrists and smelling like cigarettes and the other wore a running suit. She tells her audience she is going to fight back. A woman watching the news realizes the guy she is with could be one of them, but when she tries to call the police, he stops her. When she does talk to Benson and Stabler, she tells them he is Mark Krieger, a car parts sales rep from Cleveland. She gives them the key to her room. When they go in, he is puking in the toilet. As Benson attempts to read him his rights, he tells her the city will have to pay for his lawyer because he is broke before he pukes again causing Benson to excuse herself.Stabler tells the team Krieger works in construction and has priors including possession, assaults stemming mostly from bar fights, and kiting checks. Benson tells them he is from Queens, but he told his date different. Stabler informs them the girl knows she was almost the next victim of Mr. Goodbar. Benson tells them he lawyered up immediately. After Munch tells them he always thought it was a crime of opportunity, Jeffries tells them the perps did not even know who Sarah was. Cragen informs them they may end up having to file against Krieger and \"an un-apprehended other,\" but he wants to find the other guy before Krieger gives him a heads up. Cragen tells them to check phone records, employment records, credit card bills, and find the other guy. When the meeting breaks up, Munch asks Cragen if anyone notified Sarah about the suspect. He tells him he thought he should tell her himself.When Munch goes to tell Sarah about the arrest, she asks if he saw her piece on the news. He tells her it took guts to do that. She asks him to tell her the guy's name, but he reminds her it would jeopardize the line-up. He assures her he will tell her everything when it is over. He informs her she probably will not see the guy again until court.While Munch and Jeffries search Krieger's apartment, Jeffries guesses he only works as often as he has to. Munch tears part of a poster containing phone numbers. They figure his ashtray collection is from his one-night stands so they take them. They realize the second rapist could be one of opportunity.In the squad room, Cragen interrupts Benson and Stabler as they look at the bars advertised on the ashtrays. He reminds them of his drinking days. Benson asks him which one is closest to the attack. He responds with Shad's Cabaret adding it is just a bunch of hard working locals and confused out-of-towners. He asks that they let him know if anything has changed. While Munch tells them he came up empty on his calls, Jeffries tells him she found one that knows Krieger.   When Jeffries and Munch talk with Krieger's cousin, P.K., he informs them he has not seen him since Labor Day. He tells them Krieger is always getting into trouble. Stabler finds Krieger owes Shad's Cabaret $36, but he used his credit card. When the owner cannot tell him what Krieger bought, Stabler explains the drinks would tell him if he was drinking alone or with someone. The owner tells him the only information on the receipt is the date of January 11th. Sarah walks into the line-up and is introduced to everyone. Cragen explains the men will not be able to see her. Munch adds if she does not recognize anyone she needs to make sure before saying so. At her request, Cragen asks the men to roll up their sleeves and turn their wrists out. When all of them have the tattoo, she gets a little confused, but points out number three.As Munch escorts her from the line-up, he tells her the man's name is Mark Krieger and he is a welder from Queens. After he tells her they interrogated Krieger but he did not talk, she asks him if they can make a deal with him to give up the other rapist. He reminds her his lawyer will not let them talk to him. When she tells him she wants to know why the chose her, he tells her rapists give excuses they hear on television and in movies to judges and journalists after they are convicted. The truth is she will never know why they chose her and they may never catch the second guy. Cragen informs the team he has received three calls in two days from One Police Plaza inquiring as to where they are on Sarah's case. Munch informs him they have DNA, a witness placing him in the neighborhood, and Sarah. Cragen reminds them they still do not have the second guy and it has been almost a month. Stabler informs him they have checked employers, landlords, and every bar he ever stole an ashtray at and got nothing. Benson informs him Krieger did not keep friends any longer than he needed them. When Cragen asks if they have any longshots, Stabler tells him he received a call from an informant in Rikers saying he heard something from someone. At Rikers, Stabler tells his informant he was able to get his daughter's teacher to cut her some slack and do summer school and he has the principal looking out for her. His informant tells him Krieger is scared he is going down on this one, but he did not know who Sarah was when he did it. When asked about the second guy, the only thing he knows is the guy was already in Rikers on a DUI charge or something like that. When Krieger found him he told him to keep quiet or he will kill him. Stabler asks a jail administrator for a list of everyone in the day Krieger came in. She tells him that would be 16,000 names. He asks her to rule out women and children and narrows it to 12,000 men. When she asks him what he actually needs, he tells her he needs everyone who came into contact with Krieger narrowing it to 6,204 possibilities. After he is denied his request to narrow it down by age and race, she hands him a disk.ADA Alden explains to Munch that Defense Attorney Sorenson will try to rush the case to trial in order to catch them unprepared. When Munch tells her they are ready, she reminds him Sarah says she was raped by two men, but they will only be able to show the jury one. Sarah took an unusual route home so he will try to say it was more than a leisurely walk home. She reminds him they do not have semen, but he reminds her a condom was used. She does not believe Sarah is ready so she suggests he ask for Benson's help in prepping Sarah.Benson tells Sarah the defense cannot bring up her sexual history on the stand, but they may be able to allude to it. She informs her the defense does not have to prove it did not happen as long as they can muddy the waters a little. Munch tells her they will try to beat her up on the stand. They explain she will have to be detailed explaining where each person was, each body part, and explain how she could tell which guy it was. Benson tells her to answer with simple and direct answers. She tells her to use the actual names for body parts and if they make her uncomfortable talk to her or Munch until she is comfortable. In court, the defense files 4 motions, including one to exclude the witness identification, and the prosecution files one to exclude press from the courtroom. The judge states he will rule in the morning. In the hallway, Sarah questions why they are trying to exclude her identification. ADA Alden explains their only hope is to try to convince the judge and jury that everyone from the police to the witness is incompetent. Sarah responds by asking Munch to come on her show stating it has already been cleared with Cragen. Munch tries to talk his way out of it saying a woman is who she needs to have if the subject is rape. She tells him that if her audience sees him, they will be more likely to go to the police. After she bribes him with dinner after the show, he reminds her not to say the word \"bribe\" to a cop in a crowded courthouse.While Munch is waiting at the studio for Sarah, he is told there is some gridlock by her neighborhood. When he receives a call, he leaves to go to her apartment. When he arrives, a firefighter tries to stop him from going in citing the building is not safe. When he makes his way past the firefighter, Benson stops him letting him know it was Sarah. She tells him the neighbors heard a single blast. The bomb squad got the call at 6:46 and arrived at 6:52. She informs him the six minutes would not have mattered. When Munch gets to her apartment, he is told it was a black powder bomb in a box of flowers. She saw the flowers at her door and brought them in. When she opened them, she blocked the blast from the north side of the room with her body killing her instantly.When Munch arrives at work, he tells Jefferies he stayed at the scene late and Benson is still there canvassing. Cragen slowly makes his way to his three remaining detectives and asks for an update. Stabler informs them his source told him the second guy was in Rikers when they got Krieger. He narrowed the field of possibilities by age and description before narrowing it further to those who were out when the rape occurred leaving 207 men. When Munch clarifies they are going on the assumption the second guy is the bomber, he then reminds them Sarah's testimony is out unless they suggest Krieger masterminded the bombing. Stabler adds Krieger could not mastermind a church picnic. Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to work on the rape, and tells Stabler to work on the bombing with Benson and only share information with Munch about Krieger. Cragen requests Munch's presence in his office to see if he needs time off which he declines.Benson and Stabler are informed the bomb was made from a soup can, Chinese black powder, and a flammable liquid held together with masking tape wired to a remote. Benson explains the guy used a bomb instead of a gun, put it in a romantic box of flowers, and used a remote instead of a switch. Stabler picks up on where she is going realizing the guy had her life in his hands. When he asks if the park across the street from her apartment was searched, he is told they did not know to look there. He suggests the guy wanted to watch her die.While looking at the park, Stabler picks up a wrapper from a pile of throat lozenge wrappers thinking the guy may have had a cold. Benson notes the guy would have been able to see right into her apartment. The guy had to buy the supplies, make the bomb, deliver it, and kill her. They realize the perps each have their own motive and MO. One is a planner and Krieger joins in at the last minute. They realize Krieger went along just for the ride.In court, Sorenson asks the judge to quash the indictment since Sarah is dead. ADA Alden asks they allow her journals and statements to the police in under Geraci. The judge tells her they have seven days to link Krieger to the bombing or the indictment will be quashed. After Sorenson asks for his client to let out so he can help with his defense, the judge sets bail at $50,000. Munch expresses his disdain for the decision and is fined for contempt. He only stops when the judge threatens to put him in lock-up with the next word. Jefferies ushers Munch out of the courtroom citing a call she received from Krieger's cousin.P.K. tells Munch and Jefferies he remembers a friend of Krieger's from selling pot named Tommy. He adds his last name is something Irish. When he asks if he will get the reward, Munch throws some money at him telling him to go buy himself a blunt. After locating 18 men fitting their requirements, Munch and Jefferies try Shad's Cabaret to see if he was there drinking with Krieger. After seeing a picture of Krieger and a photo array, the owner picks out Tommy McConaghWhile Jeffries acts like she is trying to pump gas unsuccessfully, Munch approaches the window complaining his wife cannot get gas and he has to be at work. When McConagh heads for the door, Benson, Stabler, and Munch meet him there with guns out to arrest him. Stabler explains to McConagh in the interrogation room that he knows about the pot bust, but does not care about that. He reminds him he was in jail for a week when Krieger approaches him and tells him not to talk about the night they went partying at Shad's. He informs him that he will be the one going down for murder since Krieger is pinning it all on him unless he tells his story. McConagh tells him they were high and he dares Krieger to pick the lock to the swimming pool. Krieger tells him it would be a good lace to do a girl. He attacks Sarah, but he did not watch. Stabler remind him he is Irish and was raised to respect women. McConagh admits to watching the rape. In the viewing room, Jeffries comments that Krieger's bail has been revoked. Munch tells her \"Let's go.\" At Krieger's apartment, Krieger takes off running when he hears Munch and Jefferies. Krieger gets into a van and just before Jefferies gets to him, the van explodes knocking her down. Munch moves Jefferies to safety telling her he will call Cragen.Munch, Benson, and Stabler are told the bomb was the same as the one in Sarah's apartment. After they are told the guy could have been 50 feet away, they check on Jeffries. When Munch asks her to take a few days, she agrees.Stabler informs the team that the canvas is coming up empty. They discuss it may be a case where the guy thought he had a relationship with her and did not believe she should be talking about her rape on television. Cragen tells them to look through her correspondence after her story aired. Stabler tells Cragen McConagh flipped on Krieger, but admitted nothing himself. After reminding him McConagh does not know Krieger died, Cragen decides to play the disappointed father figure.After Cragen tells McConagh he knows he lied to Stabler, he asks what happened that night. McConagh tells him he held Sarah down while Krieger raped her. She asked them not to hurt her. He admits he raped her next using a condom. When she is still crying her asks her what more does she want since he used the condom.While they are searching Sarah's mail, Munch brings up the powder used in making the bombs. Benson realizes they can test for the powder residue so they all drop the mail and take it to the lab. They find a card in a red envelope. After Munch notices they did not sign it, they spray for  fingerprints. After running the prints through the criminal databases and city employees, they come up empty. Cragen tells them to run the prints through the weeds of prospective employees. They come up with Wlliam Lexner. He graduated from Queens College in 1984 and was rejected from the Fire Department six times with the most recent time being in '99. Munch reads from the psych report that he is narcissistic and thinks he has enemies preventing him from being hired by the Fire Department. Cragen tells them he wants to try to take him without incident, but plans to take the bomb squad as a precaution.After evacuating the rest of the building, Munch and Stabler are asked if they want suits. When Munch tells him he is wearing one, they are told bomb suits only make them better looking corpses making Stabler more nervous. Stabler knocks on the door claiming to have a certified check for him saying he needs a signature and it will take 6 to 8 weeks for re-delivery. When Stabler gets a few feet from the door, Lexner comes out. Munch pulls his gun while Stabler overpowers him. Cragen tells Munch they will not be able to make the case on forensics alone. They need a confession. When Munch introduces himself to Lexner, he recognizes him as the cop who handled Sarah's case. Munch tells him he is more interesting than the rape cases he handles every day. Lexner tells him rape is the worst crime of all because guys will be with the women who have not been raped before the ones who have. Munch tells him it should not matter if you care. Munch concludes Lexner saw Sarah differently after the rape. He confirms this stating she never smiled the same. Munch tells him she was a good woman who did good deeds. When Lexner asks what she was like, he told him Sarah mentioned him twice saying they clicked. Lexner tells him he wanted Sarah to be happy like she once was. He ordered the flowers she would have wanted and wrapped the box in a gold ribbon like she would have wanted and left it in front of her building. He was in the park and watched the 5:00 news. He watched her take the box to her apartment and watched for her smile before he flipped the switch."

      "corpus": "As Jen is making her way onto the subway, her cell phone cuts off. While she is on the subway, a guy slams her into the end of the car and rapes her while everyone else acts as if they see nothing.Cragen tells them they have the C train line shut down and it is the same MO as a serial rapist. Jeffries explains the prep uses a box cutter, waits until the train is about at the station and then he takes off. Stabler says it is the seventh time in six months, but Benson points out it is the third time in one month.As they make their way to the scene, Jeffries asks Munch about his sour mood. He tells her it is his anniversary but he does not know which wife. The transit cop explains the attack took place between the Fulton and Chambers Street stations and they secured the scene as soon as they heard. The CSU tech tells them the paint on the metal resists fingerprints, but a couple hundred fingerprints on the window, a couple of partial footprints, and a coffee cup are their only pieces of evidence.Jen says she took a different train than her usual one. She denies seeing him before the attack. Stabler shows her a picture resembling the Unabomber, but she says it looks like him. She describes him as thin with sandy brown hair and a pointy, beak nose. He was wearing dark clothes and a hooded sweatshirt. She tells them he left his mark on her dress.Benson and Stabler question a witness. He reminds them that on the subway, people go blind to the things going on around them. He describes the guy as being 5-foot-10 wearing a hooded sweatshirt, a navy peacoat, and he had paint on his pants. Greenberg tells Munch and Jeffries this rape fit within the pattern of no pattern. The only profile they have is a guy that wants to get caught. He says they will put cameras in next year, but it will not stop a guy from putting his hand up a girl's skirt. Jeffries reminds him it was rape. Benson and Stabler question another witness. All she can tell them is he said something to the woman, but she doesn't know what.Cragen introduces Audrey Jackson, a shrink, to the group. The only similarity the victims have is they were all wearing skirts. She says the hunt is this guy's version of foreplay. The transit cop informs Munch and Jeffries this time the guy was caught thanks to other passengers and him.When Benson and Stabler question Bruce (the suspect) he tells them he fell against the woman. He has paint on his pants and claims it is from a window when he paints houses. Benson has him remove his pants. Stabler checks out the pants and notices a pocket missing and a DNA sample. Bruce claims his knife cut it. Cragen thinks he may be Catholic making him feel guilty about everything.Munch and Jeffries speak with the woman who screamed. She tells them that the girl was reading when the train jerked. Bruce grabbed onto the pole to keep from ramming into her. When he rubbed up against her, she screamed.Nick Ganzner meets Benson in the squad room to try to obtain information about the case. She does not give him anything but public information, but makes plans for a date that evening.When Munch and Jeffries question a witness, he states when he heard screaming and saw the guy rubbing against the girl he figured that it was the subway rapist he had heard about and put him in a full nelson.The doctor tells Munch and Jeffries that the woman says she was not raped and no evidence supports a rape allegation. The woman tells them he rubbed up against her but nothing else. She also states she has learned to read and keep alert about the things going on around her. And everyone should mind their own business. Surprisingly, she tells them a guy flashed her a few weeks prior.Jackson says he did not rape the woman. Cragen says he wants the other seven victims to come in for a line up and after some discussion agrees to have them transported in themselves. Only one of the women ID him. Jen reasons that it really does not matter if she IDs him or not since they have his DNA.When the ADA tells Cragen they can re-arrest him later if the DNA matches. Cragen wants to arrest him on a lesser charge to keep him off the streets. The ADA reminds him Bruce would not plead guilty on a lesser charge if he knows he can get off on a rape. Jackson says he will plead because he is guilty. Cragen tells her to go talk with him.Jackson informs him the police know he did not rape anyone. She inquires as to why he likes riding the subway. Jackson reminds his lawyer his job is to get him a good deal and hers is to make him feel better. Bruce tells her he is from South Dakota. He had relieved himself in an adult establishment prior to getting on the subway. He says he just wanted contact. Jackson tells Cragen Bruce is not their guy. The guy they are looking for wants to get caught, but the guy they are looking for does.At a bar, Ganzner tries to get information out of Benson about the case. She reminds him they are suppose to be on a date. She says she should write a book. He agrees saying she knows these people (referring to rapist). He tells her the reason people move away from her is because she gets inside rapists. When she gets up to leave, he informs her he is not going anywhere so she invites him over.At her place while they are kissing, she breaks away from kissing to put on jazz music. When he asks if she has sex with her eyes closed after everything she sees everyday, she tells him her eyes stay wide open. He suggests role-playing with him as the subway rapist. She stops his advances and tells him to be gone by the time she gets out from washing her hands and her mouth. Ganzner quickly removes a file from her desk before leaving.Benson walks into Cragen's office as he is reading the paper. He explains the reporter was able to get into the head of the rapist. She explains Ganzner was at her apartment and turned her back on him after asking him to leave. Cragen tells her to never turn her back on a reporter. She tells him she has learned her lesson and will take care of the problem with Ganzner. Munch walks in informing Cragen of another rape at Delancey Street station. Cragen tells him to take Jeffries.At the scene, the transit cop tells them a witness saw a card fall out of the perp's pocket onto the platform. After a little searching, they find a parking stub from Queens. At the parking lot, they are told the car is not there. Jeffries looks at the records and finds the car was picked up a few hours before. The attendant describes the rapist and tells them the guy drives different cars with Dewell's Painters Contractors. At Dewell's, they learn Sal Avelino is the only white guy who works there and they never know when he will come back when they send him on an errand.Munch and Jeffries take him to the station and log his possessions, including two driver's licenses, including one for Sidra Lonstein and a Metro card. When checking Avelino's travels, the computer freezes up.Sal's lawyer informs Cragen he wants to be number one in the line up. Jen identifies him immediately. Jeffries informs her they will contact her about testifying. Jen walks into the room full of witnesses waiting to identify the guy to get her scarf and tells everyone it was quick. Briscoe was not able to react fast enough to shut her up. In Cragen's office, Munch reminds Briscoe they were not suppose to talk. Briscoe says he cannot control six women at once, but he is okay in the field. Cragen tells him he needs to react faster. In court, all of the victim's identifications were thrown out causing the case to be dismissed.In the squad room, Stabler expresses the incredulity of the fact the judge could even think consensual sex could occur on the subway with a stranger holding a box cutter. Cragen tells them to locate Sidra Lonstein seeing as how she could be an uncontaminated complaining witness. Stabler opts to go with Munch considering Jeffries is watching Avelino work until she can arrest him.Munch and Stabler locate an older man who tells them Sidra is at work at a subway station five miles away. Benson goes to confront Ganzner at work. She tells him about getting reemed by Cragen saying it looks like she screwed up. She gives him a cold case file explaining it is about a man who uses women without the slightest twinge of regret like him. As she insults him, she ensures make her volume loud enough to where the entire office could hear the information. Munch and Stabler locate a pregnant Sidra and return her license. She explains she lost it when some guy bumped into her on the subway.Cragen, Munch, and Stabler make Sidra comfortable in Cragen's chair with her feet propped up. She tells them she is about 32-33 weeks pregnant. Stabler tells her he learned pregnancies are not actually nine months with his first child - it is more like 10. Cragen tries to ask if the \"bump\" was actually rape, but she denies it at first. She identifies Avelino. Cragen tells Stabler to take her to the vending machines for food. Stabler warns her of his cold, but she ignores his warning and takes his hand. Cragen tells Munch to bring Avelino in for questioning.Munch tells Avelino he has a court order for an amniocentesis on a complaining witness. He realizes that must mean someone is pregnant. Munch and Jeffries explain that even though he got away with the other rapes, he won't get away with this one. The amniocentesis will nail him for this rape. In the squad room, Stabler asks Sidra if she is feeling all right. She says she is. When he tells her he is now that she has touched him, she looks at him strangely. Munch and Jeffries bring Avelino through. When he sees Sidra, he admits to the rape in front of everyone."

      "corpus": "Karen Raye calls her mother from a payphone at 21st and 7th asking for a ride saying she was raped. At the hospital, she tells Benson and Stabler \"the yachtsman\" took her to a vacant lot, pulled a gun on her, raped her, and told her if she tells anyone he will kill her.She explains she met him in a chat room and felt he was harmless with that name. He said he would pick her up at the coffee house at 7 in a beige Mercury Sable.At the station, Benson hands out copies of a sketch of 16-year-old Karen's attacker. When Munch suggests they work with the Coast Guard because of his name, Cragen informs him they met in a chat room. Benson tells them they need to speak with Karen again. Cragen tells them that by the time the lab tells them anything the guy could be half way around the world. Jeffries volunteers to check the victim's computer. Cragen informs her Karen lives with her mother in Brooklyn and sends Munch with her to pick the computer up. Munch muses there are 70 million suspects on the internet.Benson and Stabler speak with Karen in an interview room. Stabler verifies the prep picked her up at 7 and she checked in at the hospital a little after 11. She tells them they talked about school and drove around to different places. She states they have been corresponding for three or four months and she decided to meet him at the time because her mother had choir practice. Stabler suggests they drive through the events to help them find the guy.Melissa Raye, Karen's mother, tells Munch and Jeffries she dropped Karen off at the library at 6:15, but when she went to check on her at 8:30 she was not there. Karen is not allowed to date. She is allowed to attend church and school functions as long as there is a chaperone. She is allowed to have boys over as long as they are friends. She informs them she never married Karen's father, but he has court-ordered visitation. The computer Karen uses is at her father's apartment.Benson and Stabler are attempting to drive through Karen's night. She shows them the corner he picked her up at and the direction he was driving in. She tells Stabler to make a quick left, but he turns right informing her it is a one-way street. She figures she was just wrong about the direction. Munch and Jeffries speak with David Marolo, Karen's father. He tells them Karen is a good student. When he informs them she downloaded a lot of music, he adds she knows more about computers than he does. They request to take the computer causing him to warn them there are pictures of nudes posing with animals on it that are password protected.Benson, Stabler, and Karen arrive at a lot where Karen claims she was raped. There are a lot of people around so they question her statement of no one seeing or hearing them. She realizes they do not believe her and tell them it is worse than the rape. Benson tells her they need to get the details right so if she is missing something she needs to tell them.When Benson, Stabler, and Karen return to the squad room, Karen questions how they obtained her father's computer. After Munch informs her that her father wants to catch the guy, Stabler has Debbie take Karen into the interview room and get her a soda. Once she is out of the room, Benson sees a picture of Miss September posing with an ocelot. Stabler informs them he doubts the existence of \"the yachtsman.\" Munch tells them the guy sent her e-mails and encrypted pictures. He hands over the e-mails as Jeffries tells them a tech guy is coming to try to help them view the pictures.When Benson and Stabler confront Karen with the e-mails, she admits she never met \"the yachtsman.\" She was with her boyfriend and they made love. She did not want her mother to find out because she would have made her undress in front of her and smell her hair. Stabler informs her filing a false police report is a crime and took their time away from helping real rape victims. After Benson hands her a pen and pad to recant the original story and to tell the truth, Karen asks if they are going to arrest her boyfriend. When she tells them he is 21, Stabler tells Benson they need to talk to him.Stabler speaks with Keith, Karen's boyfriend, in an interview room. Once Stabler verifies Keith knew both of their ages, Keith explains Karen is more mature than the girls he has met in college. Stabler assures him she is not that mature before he asks if he knows what Statutory Rape is. Stabler tells him to give it a rest for a year or year and a half and if after that he still wants to see her then he will not have any problems with him.As Stabler returns to the squad room, he announces the only difference between them and Robbery is robbery victims do not lie. Cragen informs him the case was not a total waste of time. He is told the pictures \"the yachtsman\" e-mailed her was of his blacked-out face and young girls. When Stabler says he does not need to look at it, Cragen reminds him it is evidence.When Stabler tells Kathy about the pictures, Kathy tells him she gets e-mails like that every day. Stabler clarifies with these sites you never know the people's real ages. They realize their children are probably getting these e-mails as well. Stabler tells Kathy he cannot restrain someone he cannot see or hear. He reminds her these predators are in their own home through their computer.Benson and Stabler are told the ISP respects their clients' privacy. When they inform him one of his clients posted sex pictures of himself with minors and they are sure he wants his other clients to know he is helping to stop the problem, he types the screen name into the computer. He explains that every time you click your mouse you are sending out personal information. Benson compares it to a constantly running tape recorder. They are told \"the yachtsman\" is actually Harry Waters. He likes to visit sex chat rooms, porn sites, programming sites, music sites that appeal to teen girls, poker, and auction sites. He won seven panty auctions on e-bay. He works at universal.net.At universal.net, they are told Waters was a great programmer, but he was not liked. After the company received their ISP, they went to Cuba. While every one else went to the Orioles game, Waters stayed behind saying he was sick so they bought him some souvenirs. When they tried to deliver them, a young girl came out and asked if they wanted a good time too. When they returned, Waters quit and no one wanted to touch his computer. He gladly gave them the computer.Jeffries informs Benson and Stabler the only thing they got off the computer were file names of files stored on Keith's computer. They pick Keith up and bring him back to the station. Stabler cuffs him to the interrogation room table. Keith tells them he was just storing it and he does not know what it is in the files. Stabler tells him he is either getting something out of it or he is storing it for his best friend. Stabler reminds him the girls are underage, drugged, and being photographed without their permission after Keith claims they are just pictures. Keith admits they are his pictures. It started out as revenge on an ex-girlfriend of a friend. When they posted them, they received e-mails from guys willing to pay. At first it was girls they knew, then they began taking requests. Stabler explains he is a pimp. Keith tells them he was paid in cyberbucks so it would be untraceable and keep the cops away.When Maureen comes down and tells Stabler she is going to Hannah's to study for a history test, Stabler reminds her the test is on Tuesday so Hannah can come over to study. She tells him Hannah's house is quieter because she is an only child causing him to ask if she is going to her mother's or her father's. Maureen realizes he should not know this information so she asks if he has been reading her e-mail. He explains he wanted to see if someone has been sending her something they should not. She tells him she receives ten junk e-mails a day and she deletes them all. When she asks if he wants to read her journal, he causes her to storm off after trying to verify she has journal.While Munch cleans the spilled coffee from his desk, he informs them Pam Anderson and sex are the top two search terms on the net. Stabler clarifies Pam Anderson is over eighteen, but the girls in the pictures are not. Munch reminds them they could be faked. Cragen tells him he would rather hear the excuses from the perp. When Cragen tells them to trace his e-mail, Jeffries tells him the guy reroutes his sessions so they cannot trace it. Cragen tells them to track him down on one of the sites they know he visits and give him what he wants.While Munch is in a chat room posing as 12-year-old \"Nicole,\" \"the yachtsman\" explains to \"Amy\" how to get Prozac from her parents. Cragen tells Munch to talk to him. Munch tells him he may need some Prozac as well because his parents are harsh. Munch relays \"the yachtsman\" wants to meet the next day at a café in Chelsea at noon.When \"the yachtsman\" approaches a girl and introduces himself, Munch interrupts saying he is \"Nicole.\" Stabler helps Munch escort Waters out of the café as Waters tells them they need to talk to his lawyer.As Cragen and ADA Eastman walk into the room where Waters is sitting with his lawyer Hammonds, Hammonds asks them what the charges are. Eastman tells her he is charged with soliciting a minor. Hammonds reminds them he solicited a detective pretending to be a minor. Cragen asks to speak with her off the record. Cragen explains the incident in Cuba and corrects her when she claims he was fired from that job. Hammonds tells Cragen she understands his warning, but she will not neglect her duties to her client. Once she is gone, Eastman warns him she is going to claim Waters knew he was talking to an adult the entire time. When he tries to tell her he has solicited real minors, she explains cyber-crimes are tough to prosecute.When Cragen explains Eastman needs a real live victim, they tell him the only contact he made was the panty auctions. Benson guesses he may have been more interested in the return address. Jeffries tells them he bought three pair from a 15-year-old in Queens.When Munch and Jeffries arrive at Doris Harrington's residence, they find a group of elderly ladies sitting at the table gambling. Jefferies locates a pile of brown packages and opens one pulling out a pair of panties. Doris explains they advertise \"used homecoming queen undergarments.\"At St. Monica's High School, Benson and Stabler are informed the faculty and staff are checked by an outside firm. They had security features on the internet, but the program prevented the students from researching important topics so they blocked the program. When they are introduced to Elaine, Benson asks if she knows Harry Waters and Stabler adds his screen name. She tells them she and Waters had a thing. They decide to finish their discussion at the station.Elaine tells them she met Waters when he came to her house one day wanting to order more panties. He asked her about school, the music she likes, and what she likes to do for fun. She told him she was fourteen. He told her his daughter died in a wreck. They became intimate in September. They met at the park by the fountain on a Saturday. She explains her father left when she was eight. She continues saying Waters took her to a restaurant by the lake and treated her like a princess. When she tells them his smell reminded her of her father, Stabler excuses himself.Stabler asks Cragen if they have anything on this guy. When Cragen tells him there was no real sex, Stabler reminds him the guy perved her in ways she is not even aware of. Cragen tells him to pretend she told them they had and bring him in on having an improper relationship with a minor. Stabler promises to have him there in the morning.When Waters and Hammonds arrive, Stabler tells them the 14-year-old's story is different. They watch as Jefferies escorts Elaine out of the squad room before Stabler continues saying it is different when the victim is in the flesh. Waters decides he wants to talk. Eastman lists off the crimes Waters can be charged with. When she mentions a federal charge, Hammonds tells her if it goes federal she wants a trial. Stabler offers to take the charge off the table if he gives up his other contacts with minors. Hammonds agrees to the case involving Elaine only, he becomes a registered sex offender, and joins a program. Stabler says he must do some time. She tells them Waters can give them the names of nine pedophiles. Stabler offers five years with six months knocked off for each pedophile that is convicted.  She agrees to present him with the offer. Waters tells Benson and Stabler he met pedophiles the old-fashioned way. When he sees a guy in a kid-oriented place with no kids, he would ask him about a G-rated movie.Stabler makes his way downstairs and tells Maureen to quit hitting the computer. He tells her he put a child lock on it, but he will take it off so she can do her homework. When he cannot get it off, he asks for her help. After she gets it off, she asks him when he is going to start trusting her. He explains his current case and tells her this is about fear not trust. She asks him to stop reading her e-mail. He agrees and apologizes.Cragen explains he will be in the storage room with Benson and Jeffries. Stabler says the signal will be flashing the banquet room lights twice. Cragen tells them Stabler and Munch will be in the room. Eastman tells them they can say just about anything because the tape will not be used to convict anyone, but they need as many details as they can get so they can locate other witnesses.While Stabler and Munch get the pedophiles talking, Benson notes the details. When one pedophile offers product, the calvary arrives. Munch ends up with an undercover FBI agent.When Cragen gets to his office with the agent, he tells the agent he was working a sex crime in his jurisdiction and did not have the courtesy to tell him. The agent informs him they are in several places trying to get these guys and now the ones they arrested could be giving the others a heads up. Cragen muses the pedophiles are winning because while they are working together, law enforcement is not.Stabler draws Benson's attentions to the butterflies the prep drew on the pad. The prep tells them when the kids leaves the station they are in tears, but when they leave him they are all smiles."

      "corpus": "When a housekeeper arrives to clean the messy hotel room, she finds a woman's body in the bed as she pushes the sliding glass door open. When Benson and Stabler arrive, a CSU tech comments on the number of fingerprints in hotel rooms. Stabler notes the condition of the room. The tech informs them the victim did not have any valuables anywhere in the hotel. Benson notes the victim's purse does not contain money or jewelry. After noticing marks on the victim's neck, Stabler guesses she died of asphyxiation. The ME puts time of death from 4 to 10 in the evening. Since the arms are crossed, they guess it was personal.Benson and Stabler arrive in the middle of a discussion on rape between Munch and Jeffries. Cragen interrupts their banter for the team meeting. Benson and Stabler inform them the initial cause of death is presumed to be strangulation early in the evening. Their guess is it was a Robbery-Rape-Homicide. There was no sign of forced entry. If she fought back, she did not fight for too long. When they cannot rule out a type of suspect, Stabler informs them they are doing exclusionary prints and DNA of all the hotel staff before Cragen asks about the victim. The victim is Sylvia Hadley. She is married, but her husband is in Baltimore. She is in New York with her father-in-law, Dr. Benjamin Hadley, and his wife to attend the National Conference of Christian Colleges. Dr. Hadley is the president of Midvale College. Her husband has been notified and is on his way. When Stabler informs Cragen they need to speak with the in-laws again, he tells them to be direct, but discreet because he can smell the politics.ME Rodgers informs Munch and Jeffries she has confirmed the cause of death as manual strangulation and narrowed the time of death to between 6:30 and 9. The rape kit was positive for semen as well as the sheets and it is a good sample.Benson and Stabler are told by the Hadleys that Sylvia decided to skip the mixer stating she was tired from walking around the city. They inform them Brad Weber, their financial guy, and Sylvia have been working late on the annual report. They deny she has any enemies.The head of security tells them they have separate cameras watching the guests and the staff. They also have electronic locks that register whenever a door is opened. He gives them the logs to her room as well as any other activity. He warns them the video is not time stamped, but they can have it. He informs them the Baxter Arms was burglarized. As they leave, Benson reads the printout and relays the information to Stabler. The maid cleans her room at 9:25 and she did not have any room service during the crucial time on Sunday. After Stabler notes she got to her room at 5, he suggests the perp was waiting on her and left when he would not be seen.Benson and Stabler meet with Brad Weber at his office. He confirms he and Sylvia met Sunday night to go over the report stating they had a meeting scheduled for later today. He worked late at the office, went window shopping on Fifth Avenue, and returned to the hotel around 9 and crashed. The only ones that may be able to confirm his story would be the front desk if they were awake.When Munch asks Sylvia's husband, Ben, if they were having any problems, he tells them she was not having an affair. When Jefferies asks if they were having financial trouble, he asks if they have to put their private lives under a microscope claiming it was a New York psycho that killed her. After Jefferies assures him they are doing everything they can, Munch introduces Benson and Stabler as they walk in as the detectives on the case. Once they tell him they are working on some leads, he excuses himself stating he needs to see his parents. While Stabler places a call, Benson informs them Brad Weber left the office around 6 and did not return to the hotel until around 9. Munch informs her the only staff in the room so far were a maid and a room service guy with an alibi. When Benson tells them about a burglar hitting pricey hotels, Stabler informs them there is a task force on it. Benson hands the security videos to Briscoe to view and warns him they are not time stamped. Stabler tells them the latest burglary victim is Lana Hoffman, a guest at the Sussex.Lana informs Benson and Stabler that not only was her safe cleaned out, but the burglar masturbated in her underwear. The other detectives dismissed it. She tells them of a thin, creepy guy always sitting in the lounge wearing a red baseball cap and wire-rimmed glasses. She adds he rode the elevator up once. Benson and Stabler tell the burglary detective they could have helped him on this case by telling him he is wasting his time looking for the property, the perp stalks his victims for a few days first, he likes blondes, and he gets half of his rush from being in plain view in the hotel. The detective tells them no one wants to call them because of the perversion they deal with and they are afraid they will catch it. Benson receives a call from Cragen informing them the victim was pregnant making it a double homicide.In the squad room, Jeffries informs them Briscoe is sorting the videos using the hotel's schedule so it will take time. The team works through what they know about the burglaries. They started four months prior with the Baxter Arms from a little over a week ago being the most recent. Each hotel is hit once or twice. There are no signs of forced entry, the occupants are never there, and the perp did not use a staff card. Only hotels with electronic key card access to the rooms are hit. Munch wonders if he is using something to crack the lock codes speculating he may be former FBI or CIA. Cragen interrupts them to play part of a press conference Dr. Hadley is holding. When Cragen asks where they are, Stabler tells him they have the description of a burglar with a similar MO.The team goes to Ralliston Hotel. While Munch and Jeffries share an elevator with their suspect, Benson and Stabler wait patiently for the room number. When John Fenwick gains access to the room, Jeffries calls the others to join them. When they arrive, Munch slides the electronic key card giving the team access. They are able to arrest Fenwick without incident. As they escort him to the car, the burglary detective tells them it is their collar since their investigation has been going on longer. Benson and Stabler inform him their captain spoke with the mayor and he did not like their unwillingness to cooperate. When the detective grabs Stabler, Stabler fights back. As they put Fenwick in the car, he tells Munch and Jeffries if Stabler is the one to question him then he wants his lawyer present.Fenwick tells Munch and Jeffries he created the device he used to gain access to the room with his knowledge of electronics and computers. The items stolen are in his apartment neatly cataloged so they can be returned. He was doing it to prove the point of it being too easy to get by electronic locks. When his lawyer tells him to shut up, he reminds him that his job is to get him the best deal. Munch and Jeffries give them time to talk when they hear a knock on the one-way. They tell Benson and Stabler their next round will be bad cop. Benson and Stabler asks their opinion on whether to tell Sylvia's family about her pregnancy. Munch and Jeffries agree they should withhold the information before heading back in. They ask Fenwick about his alibi for Sunday night. He tells them he stole a diamond-studded collar from a terrier at Soho East. Benson and Stabler tell the Hadleys they do not have the guy. Stabler tells them it does not help them to get the press riled up. Ben wonders what is so hard about it when his wife died in a hotel.Jeffries verified the theft of the dog collar and is working on a search warrant for Fenwick's apartment. Benson suggests Sylvia had not told her husband about the baby because she was having an affair. Jeffries thinks she may have just wanted to be sure first. Benson wonders if someone else could have been stalking Sylvia the same night. Cragen thinks she knew the guy. Munch thinks she may not have been family oriented. Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to stick with Fenwick and Benson and Stabler to check out Sylvia at the hotel.At the Versailles Hotel, Benson and Stabler speak with Room Service. They are told Sylvia would order something and then when it was delivered she would think of something else she wanted. The night before she was killed, they told her they could not restock her mini bar so she went to the bar. They never saw another person in the room, but there could have been. In the bar, the bartender tells them Sylvia was there on Friday and Saturday night. On Saturday night she was with Brad Weber. She was trying to lose control while he was trying to keep it. The two left together.Benson and Stabler call Weber in for questioning. He claims the account is high maintenance and they are his biggest clients. When he denies having an affair with Sylvia, Benson tells him the bartender saw more than an investment meeting. She hit on him and he felt she could ruin his life. Stabler informs him that is called a motive for murder. Even though he drank the beers slowly they still went to his head. He found himself walking her back to her room. They kissed outside her room. He realized he just changed his relationship with his wife forever so he went back to his room. He sticks with the fact he was in his room Sunday night. When he tells them he did not watch any paid movies, they tell him that does not look good for his story.Dr. Hadley tells Benson and Stabler he has known Weber for a long time and he is good with the endowment's money. He informs them Weber was usually drunk at their functions and hitting on the women. With Ben standing behind him, he implies Weber was sleeping with Sylvia stating Ben just did not want to see it. Benson and Stabler meet with Weber and his attorney in an interrogation room. He admits to drinking often at Midvale functions because of the stress involved. He explains the extra time with Sylvia saying Dr. Hadley made a bad deal when he bought the college and now there is a balloon payment due on it that requires a lot of planning. He agrees to a blood test to get him off their suspect list. Jeffries informs the team Midvale was censured by the American Academy of Academic Professors because Dr. Hadley fires anyone who disagrees with him. Benson verifies Dr. Hadley's degree stating he earned it from Lutheran Ministry College in Jackson, Mississippi. Stabler thinks they can get more information from Ben so Cragen sends him and Benson to the memorial service. Cragen sends Munch and Jeffries to track down one of the fired professors.The fired professor tells Munch and Jeffries he is a professor of Philosophy and began teaching at Midvale in '89 because of its c curriculum. He realized the curriculum meant nothing to Dr. Hadley other than the wealthy donors it attracted. Sylvia spent more time working with Dr. Hadley than living with Ben. While Ben got his job from his father, Sylvia was headstrong. Benson and Stabler arrive at the memorial service in time to hear Dr. Hadley announce the establishment of the Sylvia Stone Hadley Memorial Fund. When the service is over, they inform Ben that Weber offered his DNA. When they ask if there is anyone else she had frequent contact with they should be looking at, he admits over the past several years she had changed so much he did not know her or her life.Jeffries informs Cragen the DNA excludes the former employees. Cragen informs them Weber's DNA cleared him and he resigned as manger of the endowment. Dr. Hadley was being honored by his peers. Ben was grading papers in Baltimore. Sharon, Ben's mother, seems to be the glue that holds the family together. Cragen wants the family's DNA. He tells them to ask nicely, but get a warrant if they need to. He also wants Sharon questioned alone.Sharon tells Benson happiness is highly overrated. When Benson informs her Sylvia was two months pregnant, Sharon tells her Dr. Hadley had been having an affair with Sylvia for the past two years.Cragen tells the team if Sharon tries to leave, then arrest her for obstruction because he does not want her to give the men in her life the heads up that they are coming for them. He orders Ben and Dr. Hadley brought in separately. Dr. Hadley lawyers up. Benson and Stabler are called out so Briscoe can tell him what he found on the tapes. He shows them a picture of Ben on the hotel elevator around the time Sylvia was killed. They verify Ben's arrival through his credit card, ATM withdrawals, and pictures from the hotel elevator. When Benson shows the ADA the DNA test results, he decides he wants them both. Cragen tells them to put the two together and flip them both.Cragen tells Ben they caught him in a lie. After his father and his lawyer tries to defend him, Cragen asks if he ever speaks for himself. When he sticks to his story about being in Baltimore, Cragen brings Jefferies in with the DNA results. The skin under Sylvia's fingernails belongs to Ben, but the semen belongs to Dr. Hadley. Cragen asks if Ben wants to make a statement. Ben had been suspicious for some time. When this trip came up, he followed. When it took her ten minutes to answer the door, she said she was sleeping and he wanted to know who with. He started trying to shake some sense into her. When she went limp, he choked her. As Ben and his lawyer leave, Ben tells his father he cannot believe he went to him to fix this. Sharon joins them. Cragen tells Dr. Hadley Sharon knows more than he thinks. Dr. Hadley denies it. She questions if he is trying to protect her. She asks if he made up the robbery story to cover up what Ben did or to make sure he did not find out she was pregnant. She asks him if he was going to call the child \"son\" or \"Ben the third.\" When he claims it is the grief talking, she explains it is her talking after watching him have an affair for two years and father his own grandchild. She implies she is filing for divorce before she leaves."

      "corpus": "A delivery guy, Mr. Bosic, arrives and finds Mrs. Bernstein tied up and dead in her bed. When Benson and Stabler arrive, they are told she had lived there for 50 years. The attacker ejaculated on her thigh and used her support hose to tie her up. Benson suggest the rape may have been an afterthought. Stabler wonders how someone could get those ideas about someone who looks like your grandmother.When Cragen sees Stabler talking to Skoda, he questions why, but does not get an answer. Cragen tells him to wait on the shrink, but Stabler tells him he already invited him. In the squad room, Benson and Stabler inform the team on the case. The victim is 72-year-old Lenora Bernstein. She got up, had tea and toast, and filled the bird feeder. The prep came through the window she forgot to lock, tied her up, and robbed and raped her. Stabler tells them her address book is the obits so he cannot find a next of kin to notify. When Stabler wonders what kind of guy would do something like this, Skoda tells them the prep is a sexually inexperienced teen to early twenties social misfit with a sporadic employment history. He guesses he may have been abused by his mother. After Cragen tells him to keep his assumptions about how the guy felt about his mother to himself, he tells Benson and Stabler to canvas and sends Munch and Jefferies to the ME. The ME tells Munch and Jeffries Lenora died from a heart attack brought on by the attack. When Munch clarifies she died of natural causes, Jeffries adds it was during the commission of a A felony making it Murder Two. The ME tells Munch he will be able to tell when the heart attack started after he dissects the arteries and will let them know as soon as he does.When Benson and Stabler speak with a friend of Mrs. Bernstein, they learn she had many expensive jewelry, but she sold them. The only jewelry she may have had some costume pieces left.Munch and Jeffries check for her costume jewelry. The clerk tells them he had someone try to get rid of pieces like they described, but he did not buy them so he did not get names. He describes them both as Dominican or Colombian teens. One is tall with dark hair and wears a fade. The other is short and has a tattoo of barbed wire crossing his fingers and one of a dagger with blood dripping. He agrees to work with a sketch artist.Benson and Stabler take the sketch to Mr. Bosic to see if he recognizes them. He offers to say whatever they want. They tell him they just want the truth. When they ask about his partner, he tells them Jimmy was in the truck out front. When they show the sketches to Jimmy, he says he recognizes them.Munch and Jeffries takes the sketch to the streets to see if anyone can help put a name to them. They approach a young lady and she tells them it looks like Carlos Medina and Alfonso. She tells them Carlos lives in the building beside the bodega and hassles everyone that walks by. Munch tells Jeffries the victim had to pass the bodega everyday. Jeffries adds that she would have to walk right past him.  When the team reaches the building, they witness a drug buy going down. After the sale is complete, they identify themselves and approach stopping the fleeing subjects. Munch and Jeffries apprehend the buyer and find prescription diuretics. Jeffries tells him he will not get high, but he will shed unsightly pounds. Benson and Stabler apprehend Carlos and Alfonso. When they bring the three together, the buyer starts talking in Spanish. Stabler asks him if he wants them to mirandize him in Spanish and English. When Munch hands Benson the prescription bottle, Benson reads \"Bernstein, Lenora\" on the bottle. Stabler tells them they want to go talk about her. Carlos tells Alfonso not to say a word.Benson and Stabler speak with Alfonso first. He tells them to talk to Carlos. They tell him they believe he did not believe her when she told him she sold all of her jewelry and he was angry. He tied her up and raped her. He tells them he did not rape her. They tell him they will talk to Carlos about it.When they walk in to talk to Carlos, he has his head down on the table like he is sleeping. Stabler pulls him up by the collar and looks at his hand. After he mentions the tattoos, Benson tells him the guy at the pawn shop raved about them. Carlos claims he found the jewelry next to the pills. Stabler informs him they found his prints in the victim's apartment. When he tells them he helped her with her groceries, Stabler asks if he brought them in through the window. Benson tells him good samaritans do not usually rape old women. When they tell him they have DNA evidence to prove it, he offers a sample.Benson and Stable return to Alfonso and tell him he must have raped her which led to her heart attack which killed her because Carlos offered a DNA sample. Alfonso agrees to the sample saying he did not do anything like that.As Benson and Stabler make their way back to the squad room, they are stopped by Cragen. They inform him both suspects volunteered a DNA sample, but they sent them in anyway. When Cragen asks if one is playing them, Stabler tells him there could be a third guy.The ADA joins Cragen, Benson, and Stabler in Cragen's office asking why she was not told about another guy. They explain they thought there were only two guys at first, but the DNA places a third guy there. They assure her they have the two on robbery though. They ask what they can offer them for the third guy. She tells them they currently have them on Robbery One, two counts of Robbery Two, and many lesser charges. She will give them Robbery Two and Criminal Trespass giving them 5 instead of 15 if they get a name.Munch and Jefferies bring the offer to the teens. Carlos refuses saying they want the rapist and he wants a free pass. He tells Alfonso they do not want them so let him handle it. They tell them if they find the rapist on their own, then both teens will do the max. Jefferies tells the teens to enjoy the cavity search as they leave.Benson and Stabler check with an administrator at Stephen Foster High School to make sure Carlos and Alfonso ditched school on the 14th. When they are informed the two were suspended for breaking into school lockers, they ask about any other boys they hang out with or have been in trouble with. She tells them the teen she knows of does not hang out with them anymore and has turned his life around. She tells them Emmanuel Clemente was absent on the 14th.Jeffries and Munch meet up with Emmanuel. He tells them he does not hang around with Carlos and Alfonso any more and he has nothing to feel guilty about. He tells them Mrs. Bernstein used to give them quarters. When Munch and Jefferies explain that is an insult, he tells them they told her to keep her quarters. He informs them he missed school on the 14th to take his little sister to the methadone clinic.Munch and Jefferies return to the squad room empty handed. They tell Benson and Stabler that Emmanuel was seen arriving with a 14-year-old around 9:00 and stayed at least two hours. The receptionist discussed baseball stats with him. When Cragen comes in, they inform him they are back to square one. He asks if the ADA might let one of them walk and the other take the max. Skoda tells them since Carlos has been through the system he will not think twice about rolling on Alfonso. He tells them Alfonso is a follower and that will make him harder to turn, but if he is scared he may do it. Cragen tells them to use the fear to motivate Alfonso.Benson and Stabler bring the new deal to Alfonso. They tell him he will get dropped to third-degree robbery and sentenced as a youthful offender which could mean 18 months in jail or probation if he cooperates. When they tell him only one of them gets the deal, he asks if he can think about it. They give him twelve hours to think about it reminding him Carlos would take it in a heartbeat.When they return to the precinct, Benson and Stabler tell Munch and Jeffries that Alfonso wants to think about it even though he wants it. They are interrupted when Cragen informs them the DA called with a taker on the deal and they waiting for them.Benson and Stabler are surprised to see Carlos when they arrive at the DA's office. He tells them Alfonso asked for his advice and he had to counsel him against the deal. His lawyer tells them he is amenable to the terms. Carlos tells them he and Alfonso went in the window. They trashed the place when they could not find anything. When they heard a cuckoo clock sound once, Alfonso took off and he chased him down. Benson tells Stabler that it was 9:30. Stabler asked if they left the other guy there. He tells them he did not leave anyone behind. Benson reminds him if he lies, the deal is gone. He drags Alfonso back, but a white guy was there with a beige uniform was there. Alfonso tells him they need to go since they trashed the place so they leave. Benson and Stabler clarify the delivery guy raped her.In the squad room, Benson and Stabler relay the information from Carlos. Munch suspects they decided to turn the hero into a patsy. Skoda tells them the profile would make more sense if it were Carlos, but it could also be someone trying to make themselves into a hero. Cragen warns them to tread lightly because this guy made the papers and he does not want another Richard Jewell on their hands. Benson and Stabler return to the squad room with the knowledge Alfonso now wants the deal. Jeffries informs them Stan Bosic has a record. He served time in Sing-Sing for armed robbery. She notes he was not busted for any sexual assaults. Benson tells them if he got away with it, he had to tell someone and cell mates are a captive audience. Jeffries tells them he bunked with Jonathan Smith, who is now out of jail.Benson and Stabler catch up with Johnny Schmidt on his garbage route. He tells them Bosic would not shut up. He bragged about working in the pharmaceutical transportation industry and he was sleeping with women on his route. He believed no woman could resist him.Munch and Jeffries catch up with Jimmy Walp on his way to work. He tells them Bosic calls the deliveries where he is sleeping with the woman special deliveries. When they ask if he ever made a special delivery to Mrs. Bernstein, he tells them no and goes to get a newspaper. Munch and Jeffries believe he knows more than he is telling. They decide to talk to Bosic next.Benson and Stabler escort Bosic from work to the station for questioning. He denies ever sleeping with anyone on his route ever. When Benson tells him they heard different, he tells them he brags. He tells them he lied on his job application because he knew they would not hire an ex-con. When Stabler asks how they would feel when they find out he raped Mrs. Bernstein, he tells them he never touched her leading him to admit he never gave her CPR. He explains Jimmy takes the tanks up in buildings without elevators, even though he was not supposed to. When he took too long, Bosic went up to the apartment. He saw the new tank by the door, her tied to the bed, and Jimmy in the bathroom freaking out. He created a win-win situation by allowing him to keep his job, got his name in the papers, and Jimmy did not have to deal with it. Benson tells him they will just put both of them in a line-up and see who saw what.Bosic is in the first line-up. Carlos immediately says he is not there. Jimmy is in the second line-up and Carlos picks him out. When his lawyer says her client fulfilled his side of the deal, they remind her it is only if it leads to an arrest. They tell her they will send the paperwork over when it is ready.In the squad room, Munch informs Benson and Stabler of the autopsy findings. Mrs. Bernstein had two separate heart attacks. The first one occurred within one hour of the one that killed her. The ME states if she had not had the first one, then the second one would not have killed her. They tell him they just let Carlos go. Munch suggests they not lose anyone else.Jimmy tells Benson and Stabler he always took the tanks up because of Bosic's bad back. He tells them her door was ajar when he arrived so he went in, saw it was a mess, and called for her. He states he found her on the bed wearing her nightie and happy to see him. He denies tying her up and raping her. Skoda arrives at Cragen's office to a meeting with him, Benson, Stabler, and the ADA. They tell him the defense said he wrote a psych evaluation on Walp and they are calling for a hearing. They tell him that if they find Walp did not understand his miranda rights, then they lose his statement and everything that came after it. He denies writing a psych evaluation on Walp. He tells them he wrote a sticky note and put it on his desk by the DD5. When Stabler asks what was on it, he tells them \"Retarded and a question mark.\" He adds it never should have left the office. The ADA tells him it made it into the discovery packet. They are told to dig until they can find something to prove he did understand. Jefferies arrives in the squad room holding Walp's Board of Education records. When Benson tells her an IQ score of  70 or below fies him as mentally retarded, she informs them he was never tested. When they are told his grades were D's and F's, Munch tells them Einstein consistently flunked math. Benson sarcastically tells him they will argue he is another Einstein. Munch informs them Walp had difficulty sustaining employment citing he was even fired from McDonalds. Stabler reminds them he did get jobs and he did live on his own without help.Benson and Stabler get his manager to let them into his apartment with a warrant. Books are everywhere. He always paid with cash and kept the receipts. He possessed a lot of porn. When Stabler opened the stove, he found more books. The manager told him he always ate at Lilly's Diner.At Lilly's Diner, the waitress tells them he always sits at the counter and talks to whoever is next to him. He studies the menu carefully, but always orders the special.His mother tells Benson and Stabler she had seven kids. She could set him front of the television and he would be entertained for hours. She denies he was slow. She tells them she has not seen him since he was 18.Munch arrives in the squad room and informs the team the defense administered an IQ tests and he received the results. Walp's IQ is 68. Stabler reminds them it would not have been in his best interest to actually try. Stabler hands Munch a porn video case from Walp's apartment. He reads the title and hands it to Benson. When she tries to return it, Stabler tells her to flip it over. The picture on the back shows a woman in the same position Mrs. Bernstein was found. Benson reminds him Carlos and Alfonso were the ones to tie her up and Jimmy found her that way. When Skoda and Cragen arrive, Benson shows them the case. Skoda tells them when Walp saw her he probably thought he was expected to perform a sex act since the mentally retarded mimic to appear normal. Cragen tells him Walp understands enough to know he did something wrong and he does not want to lose his statement. Skoda agrees Walp needs to be locked up, but where. Stabler reminds him there are 250 mentally retarded currently sitting on death row.In court, Stabler states they found no evidence supporting Walp's mental retardation and no reason to ask Walp to read anything out loud. The defense attorney informs him the mentally retarded will act like they are reading books in public places and will wear a watch when they cannot tell time to appear normal. When Walp is asked to explain his rights, he simply repeats them. When the ADA asks if he thinks he is mentally retarded, he tells her he can prove he is not mentally retarded by telling them what he did to Mrs. Bernstein. The judge tells them he wants to hear what Walp has to say so whatever he says will be off the record. He explains he has never done t before but he has seen it on the videos. While he was on top of her, he noticed something was wrong so he tried to perform CPR, but he must have been doing it wrong. He did not know how to explain what happened to anyone so he went to the bathroom and that is where Bosic found him.Skoda catches up to Cragen at the station and tells him they need to get together on their sentencing recommendation. Cragen tells him to write the report and sign his name to it. He is upset that Walp missed the mark by 2 points. When Skoda says he saw devastation for what he did, Cragen disagrees saying he saw remorse. Cragen reminds him that while Walp is going to be able to sit in a quiet place an read Winnie the Pooh, Mrs. Bernstein gets a headstone.Skoda escorts Walp into the psychiatric hospital. As Skoda tries to explain he will help with his intake, Walp asks if he will stay with him. Skoda tells him he will stay for a while as they walk in. When Walp sees the other patients, he begins repeating \"No\" and shaking his head."

      "corpus": "Two mounted officers talking about E-bay approach a parked car telling the lovebirds to move along. One officer states the car radio would sell well on e-bay. When one officer gets to the window, he tells the other the radio was not stolen, but they shot him in the head and took his pants. When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, they are told one .44 round was found in the gearbox and plenty of fingerprints. While they are looking in the car, Stabler finds a small notebook with a time and location. Benson informs him the location is a gym where people would more likely go to play squash. A uniform officer takes them over to a family who heard the shots. The mother tells Benson she heard a pop because she had left the window open in her apartment because her radiator is broken. They are interrupted by a man wanting to give his statement because he was in a hurry. He tells Stabler he heard a boom, but he did not call the police because if he called about all of the noises he heard he would be on the phone half of his life.Cragen walks into the squad room with Benson and Stabler informing the team on their newest case as they enter. The victim was shot once in the back of the head. He is 35-year-old Dean Woodruff. He was a salesman of fitness equipment on lower Broadway. He is divorced with two kids who live upstate. His parents live in a small town near Saratoga. There were no eyewitnesses, but several heard a shot between 2 and 2:30. He was in his own car. His sales district was upstate and Jersey. Munch and Cragen agree that by using the .44 the shooter was an amateur, insecure, or a wacko citing a pro would use a .22 up close and personal so no one wakes up. Benson and Stabler inform them the spot is a grope spot for teenagers, honeymooners, and co-workers. After Munch suggests the victim may have been alone, Benson tells him his pants must have come off from the force of the shot. ME Rodgers informs Benson and Stabler she assumes the cause of death is from the gunshot wound to the back of the head since she is still picking through hair and glass fragments. When Benson questions the victim's purple legs, Rodgers tells her she believes it is just pooling. Rodgers tells Stabler not to get too excited about the fact she found semen because it could be a part of the body's natural death reflex.Munch and Jeffries check out Woodruff's office. They are told he came to work early, took short lunches, and left late. When he would make a deal, they would only deal with him from then on giving him the largest private client base. Munch asks for the list of Woodruff's clients. When Jeffries hears a woman, Moira Shannon, crying in the next room, she goes to speak with her. She tells her Woodruff was popular around the office. He would go with a group of them to Le Bar for drinks after work. Munch and Jeffries speak with a waitress at Le Bar. She asks if he skipped on some alimony or knocked the wrong girl up. When they inquire as to why she would think that, she tells them he had a never fail technique with the women. When they tell her he is dead, she tells them he left around 11:55 and he tipped 25%. Jeffries looks at the receipt noticing he used his expense account for 4 vodka gimlets, 2 cosmopolitans, and a roadkill. She tells them he could have left with anyone seeing as how the women that come in there are all the same.At Woodruff's apartment, Munch and Jeffries are told whenever Woodruff brought a woman home, she left with a key. After looking around a little, Jeffries finds 3 file folders – one with matchbooks, one with seashells, and one with cocktail napkins. They also find some cards. They are interrupted when Munch's cell phone rings and he has trouble answering it. Jeffries helps him by answering it herself. She tells him Shannon has two gun permits  – one for a 9mm and the other for a .44. She also tells him Shannon has no priors. Munch picks up a picture of Shannon and Woodruff and says she is not happy anymore.Munch and Jeffries return to speak with Shannon. She tells them she has not been to Le Bar in months. She informs them her father taught her to hunt leading to a fascination with guns. She tells them the .44 was a phase and she sold it to a gun shop in Dutchess County.Munch and Jeffries return to Le Bar to speak with the waitress again. She tells them Shannon was old news. As she looks through a stack of pictures, she tells them between each one she was with him. After a little hesitance, she tells them the lady he was with was the easiest score he had before pointing them to a table and tells them the lady they are looking for was with them part of the night. When they first approach the table, the guy gets a little upset at the intrusion. After Munch flashes his badge and Jeffries threatens to break his collarbone, his companion looks at the picture of Woodruff and tells them he was with one of the Mulroneys. In the squad room, Benson informs the team the Mulroneys make quite a large clan, but Stephanie is the only daughter left. Stabler tells them she was busted for possession and got a thousand hours of community service, Jeffries interrupts noting community service is what the Mulroneys do. Benson tells them she is 33 now and runs an investment group. When Munch tries to bring politics into it, Cragen cuts him off telling him she is a reluctant witness as of now. Stabler tells them they left a note at her apartment 3 hours prior and left several messages. The meeting is interrupted when Briscoe tells Cragen there is a lawyer, Patrick Rumsey, waiting in his office. Rumsey tells him he is acting as a family friend and wanted to give him a copy of Stephanie's statement while it was fresh on her mind. Cragen informs him they will be taking their own statement. Rumsey tells him as soon as she is ready.While Benson and Stabler wait for one of the Mulroneys, they look around at the decor. When Stabler keeps telling her things Munch told him about the Mulroneys, Benson reminds him that Munch says a lot and that is why they are there instead of Munch. Stabler notices something on the desk and asks what it is. Benson tells him it is a cigar cutter and notes it says \"Winston Churchill 1929\". They are joined by Mrs. Mulroney telling them Churchill lost it in a poker game. She further tells them every time a policeman has been in there home, someone has died. She tells them it has been 5 years to the day that her son died. When Benson tells her that her daughter was lucky, she is shocked by the remark until Benson clarifies that she survived the attack. She tries to tell them Stephanie has her own apartment, but Stabler tells her they have been there. Benson tells her kids go home when tragedy strikes. She tells them she is in seclusion in a private hospital. Benson promises if she will call her then they will leave her alone.When they arrive at the hospital, the doctor reminds them of the fact it is a private clinic and Stabler tells him he understands the hospital is endowed by the Mulroneys. The doctor explains Stephanie was admitted early the morning prior for trauma. He explains they treated the wounds and gave her Seconal to calm her. Mrs. Mulroney and Rumsey join Stephanie for her conversation with Benson and Stabler. Stabler promises to make it quick. She tells them she met Woodruff at Le Bar. They were both having a bad day. She left with him. In the car, he was leaning against the window and made a joke about the disadvantages of bucket seats. When Stabler asked her to explain the joke, Rumsey told him it was obvious. She leaned over to change the radio station, but she cannot remember the song that was playing. Then Woodruff was shot. She says the shooter had black-rimmed glasses with dark hair and a roundish face.In the team meeting in Cragen's office, Benson and Stabler inform them the information Stephanie gave them of a surprise attack is consistent with the autopsy – a single shot to the back of the head fired from outside the car. Stabler clarifies Stephanie is not surrounded by wagons, but tanks. Cragen verifies she got a good enough look at the shooter for a composite. Benson tells them Stephanie implied they did not have sex, but who knows considering she comes from a family of politicians. Jeffries suggests getting a DNA swab, but Cragen reminds them she was in the car with the victim. Benson hears the tension in his voice and asks if he is getting heat from the Brass. Cragen reminds them sympathy for the Mulroney family runs high. He tells Benson and Stabler to check out boyfriends of Woodruff's women and sends Jeffries and Munch to ballistics.In Ballistics, Munch and Jeffries are told Woodruff was killed by a Black Talon. Munch reminds them Black Talons were no longer being made because they killed too many cops were easily traced back to the manufacturers.Woodruff's ex-wife informs Benson and Stabler the last girl she knows of came to return a  Greek Philosophy book. She tells them she is not angry any more. She explains Dean's father worked in a lumber yard and Dean would work over the summer. Before long, he was running the office. He saw everything as a business transaction, but nothing was good enough for his father. She knows he had a lot of girls before the college went co-ed.At Barrett College, Benson and Stabler learn Stephanie reported that Woodruff raped her. The problem was her story never added up. They believe he seduced her then treated her shabbily resulting in the accusation.Cragen joins Benson and Stabler when they return to speak with Stephanie at her mother's home. He shows her a sketch and asks if it is accurate of the shooter. After glancing at the sketch, she tells them it is him. When Stabler tries to ask if she is sure nothing needs to be changed or added, Rumsey cuts him off. Stabler asks about Barrett College. He informs her they know she knew Woodruff from there. Benson adds she knew him intimately. Mrs. Mulroney steps in and tells Cragen they all want the same thing. He tells her he wants the truth.While in a meeting in DA Schiff's office, the agenda was to talk Cragen into getting on the Mulroney bandwagon. Cragen explains Stephanie's story is inconsistent. He tells them she had sex with the victim in Saratoga, but they are not sure if it was rape or a one-night stand. They believe she stewed in her anger and allowed herself to be picked up by him. He reminds them she was busted for possession of cocaine. Schiff tells him to find the weapon and he will have his case. Cragen reminds him they have motive and opportunity. When he is asked about the means, he reminds Schiff that 90% of the murderers he put in Attica are there without a murder weapon. Schiff tells him to talk to McCoy.In a meeting with Carmichael and McCoy, Cragen tells them cocaine users are prone to lying. He tells them she lied to them about when she met the victim and about her trauma so her mother could put her on ice. When Carmichael asks about Stephanie's reliability with the sketch, Cragen informs them they think Stephanie is the shooter citing she could not remember the song that was playing that caused her to change the radio station when she should have remembered it. When Carmichael questions Stephanie using a .44, McCoy reminds her she does not have to be the one to pull the trigger. He says he will have to run damage control with Schiff and security after the arraignment. Carmichael reminds him these people attract weirdos. McCoy cites her false statements and luring the guy to his death for revenge for charging her with Murder Two. He wants to flip her for the shooter.In court, Rumsey interrupts Judge Abrams request for a plea by asking for the restraints to be removed. Abrams agrees before Rumsey enters a not guilty plea for Stephanie. Mcoy asks for remand based on the fact her family obtained an expedited passport for her and the unlimited resources at her disposal making her a serious flight risk. Abrams states he finds it reprehensible she would lower the standards from which she was raised and he believes she would put herself above the law so he remands her to the Department of Corrections.On the courthouse steps, Rumsey tells reporters Abrams decision was wrong. He tells them she was not a flight risk, but the family had a family reunion planned in Bermuda. He believes Stephanie will be a part of that reunion when his decision is reviewed by his peers. McCoy tells the reporters the Mulroneys are used to getting their way. Carmichael tells themt hey deserve the due process of law – no more, no less.While Briscoe hands out coffee to the team, everyone is on their phones looking for a similar MO in any other cases. Jeffries breaks the reverie when she relays to Cragen there has been another shooting in a parked car, single shot with a .44 to the back of the head with the pants down.While the team is looking over the victim in the car, Benson asks for the round. The uniform officer shows it to her stating it was dug out of the visor on the passenger side. He tells them the car is registered to Stanley Brecker. When Benson asks if the woman is his wife, he tells them her name is not Brecker, it is Katish. When the team questions he, Katish tells them she did not think she would ever be involved in something like this. She implies he was shot while she was performing oral sex on the victim. She describes the shooter saying he wore Buddy Holly glasses like a little psychotic nerd. She tells Stabler she models, does temp work, and auditioned for Picnic. She tells them she met him in a bar.Benson and Stabler inform Pauline Brecker of her husband's death. They tell her they are not sure what the circumstances around his death. She tells them he was in the garment business. He was constantly worried about a union representative pressuring him or a goon asking for protection money. Jeffries informs Cragen that Ballistics is still trying to see if the bullets match. He tells her to follow the bullet. Munch suggests it could be a copycat. He tells him uniforms are in the park looking for the weapon, but have not found it yet. When Munch suggests their theory of \"Hell hath no fury\" is blown, Cragen asks if he has any new conspiracies to replace it with. When Benson informs them the wife is not even upset, Cragen asks why the killer kills the guys and leaves the girls. Stabler suggests he is a loser that never gets any himself. Meanwhile Briscoe works with Katish in coming up with a computer composite of the shooter. Jeffries enters Cragen's office informing him she went back 30 years checking the shootings using a .44. She states that out of 319, 12 were intermediate range, 3 from parked cars. She tells him two of them have arrests, but the guy tied in the Attica riot. She tells him of the open cases, there were 4 cases six years prior. One of them from the 27 and the other 3 were from the same gun. Cragen calls Lennie Briscoe asking him about a shooting with a .44 from '93-'94.Briscoe tells Benson and Stabler they never found a weapon, but they have a description of a guy with Buddy Holly glasses from a witness named Jill Templeton. After they tell them they arrested the wrong guy, Briscoe asks if he is back. Benson tells him he now has two more hits under his belt.Jeffries interrupts Cragen's wait for the other shoe to drop to tell him the bullet was from a .44 – same gun, same shooter. She also tells him she spoke with the owner of the gun shop in Jersey that sold the Black Talons to a guy with Buddy Holly glasses.Mr. Rhinehart tells Munch and Jeffries the guy would not have been noticed, but he kept dry firing the rifles. He finally told him to buy something or leave. The guy told him he wanted some cop killers before they went off the market. Since this is still s free country, he sold them to him. When they ask for the records, he tells them he is against government interference into free enterprise. Jeffries hands him a court order stating she is to and that is why she considers a court order an intrusion although sometimes it is a necessary one. He pulls the records and hands them to Jeffries. Jeffries reads 'Arthur Pruitt. December 4, 1994. 3 boxes Black Talons .44 caliber'.Stabler informs Jeffries he found five priors on Pruitt, including check kiting, forgery, and some Mickey Mouse stuff with phone sales. Benson tells the team the Feds say he was arrested with 100 credit cards at an Indian casino in California. She tells them he was released 5 months prior. He told his probation officer his mother was dying and gave an address in Chinatown. As the team gets ready to leave, Cragen tells them he is calling the 27 because it is their bust, too.When they arrive, the clerk point to Pruitt sitting on the sofa behind them. They approach him and ask if he is Pruitt. After he asks for identification, he puts on his glasses to see it and tells them he is the man they are looking for. When they search his room after arresting him, they find newspaper clippings hanging on a bulletin board of his crimes.When they put him in a line-up, all three witnesses walk in and identify him immediately. In the interrogation room, Green tells Pruitt when he saw the crime scene photos he almost blew his lunch. Briscoe tells him he and his partner were cold for weeks and could not get rid of the smell of death. Munch comes in yelling saying he is going to kill the guy himself as Jeffries weakly attempts to calm him. While he whispers \"I'm going to kill you\", in his ear, Pruitt asks Jeffries if this is legal to which she replies, \"Probably not\". Stabler tells him they have the Black Talons he bought, bu the explains it away as he is not the only one to buy them. When Stabler tells him they have 3 witnesses, he questions how they could have seen anything when the windows were fogged up because they were getting busy before explaining he has a vivid imagination. When Stabler tells him he is a gentleman of the old school, he tells them under coercion he confesses. Cragen tells Munch Pruitt confessed to killing Woodruff but Schiff is going to rip him a new one. Munch questions why the guy stonewalls them for an hour before confessing so what is his agenda.Rodgers explains to Munch the injuries to Brecker are the same as the other except he had other bruising from getting the crap beat out of him. At the same time, Munch tries to ask her out only to be shot down.Schiff tells Cragen they went on a wild goose chase on this case, but Cragen still believes he was right. When he cannot tell Schiff the case is still open, Schiff tells him he will have to fall on his sword, but it will be painless. The Mulroneys arrive and greet the men. Schiff informs them he asked the judge to dismiss the charges without prejudice in chambers to avoid further embarrassment. They express their gratitude. When Mrs. Mulroney informs Schiff she contacted Judge Abrams, Cragen took that as his cue and apologized before quickly leaving.Munch catches Cragen as he comes out of the building. He tells him the ME has doubts about Brecker. He explains the circumstances leading him to believe Brecker was a mob hit ordered by the Mulroneys. He believes Stephanie killed Woodruff. Cragen tells him he is not going to tell anyone they had this conversation. As Cragen walks away, Munch yells the Mulroneys will do anything to protect the family."

      "corpus": "During a COMSTAT meeting, the head of a Robbery Unit was relieved of his command. Captain Cragen was asked about a man masturbating on a bus. He informs the panel Benson and Stabler made an arrest the previous day. Benson and Stabler assures them they have the right man. The panel then brings up a string of rapes that occurred almost five years prior asking if anyone has looked at the cases under his command. When he tells them they have not, he is ordered to investigate the rapes. One of the victims, Victoria Kraft, tells her story and pleads for them to look into her case before the time runs out. Cragen informs her he will give her case top priority.As soon as they enter the squad room, Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to check into Jennifer Neal and gives the other two victims to Benson and Stabler. He continues to explain the ME's office is trying to link DNA samples from unsolved rapes to those in the system or not. The three cases they are looking in to did not seem to be connected originally, but now they believe it is the same guy and the rapes occurred within one week. The ME has identified him as John Doe 121 using his DNA as the way to identify him. Benson and Stabler explains the MO (wears a stocking mask, breaks into apartments, climbs into bed with them, maces them, and rapes them) and description of the guy.Benson and Stabler speak with Lois Creen. They ask if she has remembered anything new, but she has not. Benson informs her of the other two attacks. When Stabler shows her a floor plan of the apartment she was living in, she remembers that in order to get to her bedroom you had to go through the bathroom and she assumes he left through the front door. Benson informs her they are working on the case full time and to call her anytime.Cragen informs ADA Eastman they need an arrest warrant based on the rapist's DNA. She does not believe they can pull it off since there is no case law in New York, but after much persuading she takes the file with her.Munch and Jefferies speak with Jennifer Neal. She tells them the rape was the worst thing that has happened to her, but the aftermath was the best thing. She tells them she went through a deep depression, but the people around her helped pull her out of it. Munch informs her they are reopening her case because they have the DNA. They inform her about the other two victims. She tells them the guy knew her dog's name and a restaurant she ate at frequently. She states she does not remember anything new. Jeffries informs her of the five year statute of limitations.Cragen and ADA Eastman ask the judge for the arrest warrant. He asks about any identification on the guy. They show him the DNA. He tells them to give him until the end of the day to decide.Benson and Stabler speak with Victoria Kraft. She tells them she did not believe the detectives were the best or the brightest so she hired a private investigator. A neighbor told the PI of a guy on a bicycle. Benson tells her they will speak with the neighbor.The neighbor says he saw a guy on a green R500 bike speed around the corner. He was wearing a motorcycle helmet and a jumpsuit.The judge explains the reason for the statute of limitations and denies the petition. He informs them he forwarded the case to the appeals division. Outside the courtroom, Benson and Stabler tell Kraft the decision will be appealed. She tells them they fell down on the job and waited five years to try some legal trickery to get their job done. She thanks them for making this the second worst day of her life.In the squad room, Cragen informs the detectives that the statute of limitations has expired on Victoria Kraft's case. When Cragen tells them he still wants them looking at her case since she can testify against him, Munch expresses his concern about throwing civil liberties to the wind in order to catch some guys. After Stabler tells Cragen they are going to speak with the original detectives who worked the cases, Cragen asks Munch if that is okay with him.Munch and Jeffries speaks with one of the detectives in Kraft's case. She tells them Kraft sued her because she said they were derelict in their duties, but the PBA lawyers handled it. The only thing she knew about the guy was he was the kind of person nobody notices. They tell her about the other two cases.Benson and Stabler speak with the detective for Jennifer Neal's case. He tells them he knew all about her. Stabler informs him of the other two cases. He tells them the other detective, Lattimer, said most rapes were fantasies.Benson and Stabler speak with Detective Dan Lattimer. They tell him they want to talk about an old case of his. He tells them the department squeezed him out just shy of being able to get his pension. When they ask him about Lois Creen's case, he says it was a one-night stand because the guy knew a lot of personal information about the victim. Stabler tells him of the other two victims. Lattimer blows it off offering them a drink.The appeals court judge asks why they do not file against every rape. He refuses to file the warrant so they can catch these guys at their leisure.Benson asks Creen to tell her story again. She tells them the guy knew about her fascination with Brandon Lee and he called her \"Lolly\" (her grandmother's nickname for her). She also tells them of the guy on the green bike.Benson and Stabler speak with the private investigator. He informs them he believed the guy on the bike to be a messenger with Green Machine Messenger Service. When they ask him if they tried to contact the company, he tells them it had already went out of business. He also tells them they have more resources to locate the employees than he does.Benson and Stabler inform Munch the guy has been watching the victims before the attacks. Jefferies informs them the owner of the messenger service now has a laundromat.When Munch and Jefferies ask the guy about the company, he informs them all of the employees wore the green jump suits. He also states they were better messengers than records keepers. He shows them a trunk full of records telling them they can have it all.Jeffries suggests they concentrate on the billing records. Benson immediately locates four deliveries to the business one of the victims worked at.Jennifer Neal tells Benson and Stabler she no longer wants to pursue the case. She lets it slip that she knows who it is. She tells them she has talked to the guy and she talked him out of turning himself in. She believes the guy has changed. She tells them she is a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Benson reminds her the Quakers created the penal system. She also reminds her of the other victims. Benson talks her into speaking with the other victims. Kraft tells her she wants a shot at him. Creen tells her she just wants a name. Kraft threatens to pull her business from Neal's company. Creen loses control of her emotions.Benson and Stabler fill Cragen in. He tells them he wants to try for a material witness order. Stabler reminds him they have never tried to force a victim to testify.In court, the judge tries to force Neal to give up the guy's name. When she continuously refuses, Neal is placed under arrest standing by her decision. Benson reminds Cragen they just sent a rape victim to lock-up when he asks if she is okay.Commissioner Morris discusses putting a rape victim in lock-up to Cragen. Cragen reminds him they are close to losing this case and the victim is their only chance of getting this guy. Morris tells him he is getting pressure from every angle. When Morris tells him he is close to insubordination, Cragen tells him to write him up or get out because he has work to do.Benson and Stabler speak with Neal's pastor. Stabler asks if he told Neal not to cooperate with them. He denies it. Benson tells him if he would give her a list of members, it might help them find the guy. He refuses telling them they need a warrant, but he will not be alone when they returned.Benson, Stabler, and Cragen return with back-up. Benson and Stabler do not like this idea. When they make their way inside, the building is full. The pastor tries to get them to leave, but they go ahead. Benson informs another member who reminds them that \"we all believe in the separation of church and state\" that she is just trying to find a rapist. She retrieves the list she needs and leaves.The team cross-references the list with the messenger employees. They try the original employment application and then look him up for priors. They find Harvey Denis was arrested previously for burglary and decide he must have been caught before he could commit the rape. They also find he was attacked in prison requiring hospitalization. When Benson and Stabler show up at the motel where Denis works. He buzzes them in and they find he is confined to a wheelchair. Stabler puts him into the car, and the wheelchair into the trunk. Denis keeps saying, \"You got me.\""

      "corpus": "A homeless woman wonders upon a car. Hoping she can get a warm place to sleep, she opened the car door to find a dead man. She leaves the door open and walks away.When Munch and Cassidy arrive at the crime scene, Munch comments on the view. Cassidy tells him the view is nice at night as well. He begins telling him he had been there on a case, then it was a date, and finally saying it was with a guy friend of his. They are told a patrol car found the body. While checking the body, Cassidy finds a gunshot wound to the head and the groin. Upon searching the car, they find a holster but no weapon. When they ask if they had located any identification, Munch is handed a wallet identifying the man as Judge Warren Varella. He tells the other detective to be sure to seal the crime scene extra securely.Cassidy informs the team the ME places the time of death between 8 and 11 PM. Munch tells them he left work early to be alone. Benson informs them his wife last saw him as he headed to work that morning. Stabler tells them the wife is not talking. Jeffries suggest he was having an affair and his wife shot him in the groin and decided to remove his brains before telling them his cell phone battery was dead, but she is still checking to see if he may have tried to call for help. When Cragen asks if it could have been a hit, Munch reminds him he was shot in both heads. Stabler suggests maybe it was a disenchanted lover while Benson suggests a sex offender. Briscoe informs them the victim was licensed to carry and he had a permit for a 9mm. Cassidy informs them they found 9mm slugs. When Cragen suggests it was the victim's gun, he tells them they believe the gun is under the pier in several feet of water. Munch tells them they recovered one slug from the rocker panel and the other from the victim's jaw. After Benson tells them the family lawyers will not let them talk to his wife until the next day, Cragen tells them he is fielding calls from the press and the Criminal Justice Bureau, and DCPI wants him to issue a press release. He reminds them this was one of their own who was tough on sex offenders. Jeffries tells them he was responsible for the Together We're Safe house opening. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to check out the politics and Munch and Cassidy to check out all recent parolees. When Stabler leaves to head for the car, Benson assures Cassidy he knows nothing about them.In Judge Varella's chambers, Benson and Stabler are told there are 2000 sex offenders that would have wanted the judge dead. They are told a file was kept of all of the threats the judge received and they are welcome to it.Rodgers informs Benson and Stabler the shot to the groin came a minute or two before the one to the head. She also tells them she found he saliva on his glands along with Cherry Glow Lipstick. Stabler deduces he received oral sex prior to his death. Stabler decides the widow needs to start talking now.The widow tells them he always worked late and left early so she was not worried about him. When they ask if her husband was having an affair, she tells them she would be the last to know. Benson does not believe her. She believes she is standing by her man to protect his pension. Benson and Stabler meet with Emily Waterbury. She tells them the Women's Movement lost a champion in Judge Varella. She believes they should check the wife beaters and the sex offenders before checking to see if anyone in Albany could have killed him.While searching through files, Cassidy tells Munch paying for sex is pathetic. Munch responds by telling him not to publicize his office romance to everyone, invoking the \"Don't Ask. Don't Tell\" policy. Green, Melendez, and Yi are all recent parolees of Varella's. When comparing those names to the threats received, they find Melendez at the top of their suspect list. When Munch and Cassidy go to Melendez's apartment, Melendez freaks out and starts hitting his old lady. Cassidy pulls him off of her and arrests him while Munch stands between the two of them.When Benson and Stabler question Melendez, he denies knowing Judge Varella. He tells them he would not own a 9mm. He claims he was in parenting s Tuesday night. To test him, Stabler asks him what to do if his child breaks curfew. When he gives no answer,  Benson asks him why he was paroled. He tells her the Judge made him pay $2,226 to get out. Stabler informs him he failed the parenting midterm as he picks him up from his seat to return to jail.Cassidy informs Benson and Stabler the last call Varella made was to Emily Waterbury. After hearing this, Melendez's claim about bribery seems more likely. Stabler tells him she claimed not to know the judge. Cassidy says he and Munch will check out the bribe tip with other ex-cons. Benson and Stabler decide to speak with Waterbury again.Waterbury claims she cannot remember every phone call she gets everyday, but with Benson and Stabler's assistance she remembers she received a call from Varella the night he died. Stabler decides to call her on it. They also tell her they know about the charges against her for hooking. She claims the guys were boyfriends. Varella gave her clean start so she could help free truly rehabilitated prisoners so they can support their families again.At Varella's office, Benson and Stabler inform his assistant they need all appointment books, financial transactions, and records for all of the organizations the judge was involved in. She believes they are following the wrong lead.Cragen tells the team he knows judges that call their wives using calling cards to avoid even the thought of impropriety. He wants to know if the judge was cheating on his wife, taking bribes, or both. After some searching, Jefferies finds \"Together We're Safe\" has made $4.7 million in one year. When Cassidy is impressed by the amount of money this \"fledgling\" charity has made so quickly, Benson expresses that she is impressed by his use of \"fledgling\". He gets upset and causes a scene. Cragen tells all of them to follow the money before he calls Cassidy into his office. Once alone, Cragen gives him a tape of a statement he took from a 9-year-old when he was in Homicide. He informs him her mother's boyfriend molested her before killing her mother. He tells him he checks up on the girl from time to time. He wants him to go check on her for him.When Benson and Stabler speak with Waterbury again, they tell her they just want to solve the homicide case. She tells them Varella would convince the guys if they gave to a charity, then it would improve their image. She explains that when he called her to tell her yes or no on a parole vote, she would handle getting the bribes where they needed to go. She informs them the only thing Varella got out of it was the sex.When Benson and Stabler speak with Tyrell's wife, she confirms she was having sex with Varella to get him out of jail. Her last visit to Tyrell serves as her alibi.When Munch claims the charity is fake, Stabler tells him it was the donations that were fake. Benson informs the team three of the women stayed at the shelter. Cragen sends them back to the pier to see if they can find anything that may have been missed.While searching, Munch and Cassidy find the homeless woman. She tells them she heard the gunshots and saw a lady in a blue uniform got out of the car. When Munch gets mean with her, Cassidy makes him back off. They take her to the station to do a computer composite.Cassidy tells Benson and Stabler the homeless woman does not know what kind of uniform the woman was wearing. Stabler tells Cragen the last parolee Varella was working on was Roger Silver. Benson informs him two of the members of the parole board were on the take. He tells them to talk to the third.When meeting with the third member of the parole board, Benson and Stabler are informed she knew there was something going on, but she chose not to know the details. She tells them it is two against one vote. She explains the board meets once a month for one day and they each get paid $20,000 a year. While sitting in the hallway looking over the files, they notice Roger Silver's wife, Gina, is a flight attendant for Intercontinent Airlines. When Stabler looks at his watch, Benson sends him home in hopes his family has not changed the locks on him.The next morning, Stabler brings Benson a donut. She tells him Gina Silver and Varella have exchanged lengthy phone calls for two years. She informs him that Roger Silver was denied parole 3 times before and is up for parole again next week. Stabler cannot believe Gina would want Roger out of jail after he almost kills her. Benson reminds him it is not unusual.When Benson and Stabler ask Gina about her relationship with Varella and tell her they know about the four calls a week for 2 ½ years, she asks them if they can talk somewhere else. They tell her they have a car outside and wait while she tells her daughter she is leaving to talk with them. Before they leave, Stabler reassures her daughter that she will be back soon.When they get to the precinct, Munch and Cragen have the homeless woman look at a line-up containing Gina, but she is unable to pick her out. Gina's lawyer tells them without the eyewitness they do not have a slam dunk case. Benson tells him they can link her lipstick to the lipstick found on Varella. Stabler tells him once they get a DNA swab, they will have their slam dunk.In an interrogation room, Gina tells Benson and Stabler that Varella called her that morning and told her to meet him at the pier. She explains the calls were one-way phone sex and he confided in her who was on the take and in which department. She tells them the meeting at the pier was for her to pay her annual dues. When she finishes paying her dues, he tells her he has to end it. She tells him to make the call, but he told them \"wife's request denied\". She knew where he hid the gun so she got it and shot him. When Stabler asks for clarification as to why she wanted Roger out, she tells him she was doing this to keep him in.While meeting with the ADA, Cragen is showed pictures of Gina Silver's injuries. He tells him the charge was attempted murder. The ADA tells him since she killed a judge, it is a federal case and he cannot choose the charge. Cragen reminds him the judge was using and abusing women while he was supposed to be doing all of these things to help them. The ADA tells him to send his detectives to meet with Roger to prepare for Gina's trial.Roger sticks to his story about her hitting herself. Stabler tells him Varella is dead. When Benson asks if he knew about a relationship between Varella and Gina, he tells them he would call Gina to talk with his daughter before his parole hearings but she told him he would never see her again. Before he leaves, he tries to get them to deliver a threat to Gina.Cragen goes to the State Attorney General's office and gives them the files for Varella's activities. He explains Varella was not only exchanging oral sex for parole, but he was charging for the service.When Benson and Stabler meet in Cragen's office, he tells them the State Attorney General offered Gina a deal if she would flip on the others involved. After they both blow a gasket, he informs them that they can charge her later. He orders them to run the paperwork over to the courthouse before Gina is arraigned.When Benson and Stabler meet with Gina, they explain she will still be eligible for prosecution when the state is finished with her. They further explain if the information she obtains is no good, she will be arrested. When they tell her she lives in the area of the city dealing with a high crime rate and she will be getting minimal protection, she clarifies she will be on her own. Stabler tells her they do not like the deal she got, but they have to follow orders. After they explain what she needs to do, they take her home and begin the operation.   Cragen informs Benson and Stabler Roger Silver has Gina. When they leave Cassidy comes in and tells him he talked to the girl. After Cragen gives him a shot of alcohol, he informs him a guy the girl liked did her, then she was gang raped by seven or eight guys. The guys left her there alone and cold with nothing but a beach towel. She was so hurt she couldn't walk. When a guy comes by offering to help her comes along, she accepts his help only to be hurt again. When he breaks down, Cragen offers to let Cassidy a transfer to Narcotics.When Munch sees Cassidy packing up his locker, Cassidy tells him he is leaving. When he tells Munch of the offer to transfer, Munch tries to talk him into it. Cassidy gives him a small Nerf football before he walks out for the last time.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, a uniform officer informs them Roger is holding Gina hostage. He also tells them a hostage negotiator is on the way, but he does not believe it can wait that long. Roger has Gina in the laundry room on the floor holding her down with one foot and a gun pointed at her. They both enter the room with their guns pointing to the floor. Stabler tries to talk him out of his gun. The closer Stabler gets, Benson trains her gun on Roger. When he aims at Stabler, Benson shoots him."

      "corpus": "Emily and her mother arrive home from a trip to find Emily's father, Andrew, dead. While Benson talks to Emily's mother, Stabler speaks with Emily. Her mother explains her son was at a bachelor's party in the Hamptons and hitched a ride home with them. Emily tells Stabler her dad wanted a divorce. Her mother tells Benson her husband would have sex with anything or anyone. When asked why someone would sodomize him with a banana, she explains he was allergic to them before excusing herself to call her son, Adam.In the squad room, Munch and Stabler agree on the fact that whoever used the banana knew he was allergic and may not have been trying to kill him since that would stop an allergic reaction. Benson does not understand why the wife stayed knowing about his extra activities, but she has an alibi which is confirmed by Emily, who Stabler does not believe would lie to protect her mother. Cassidy remains hung up on the guy in the photo. Jeffries tells them the widow and the kids share $100 million as a result of Andrew Harlin's death. Cragen tells Jeffries to pull all of Harlin's records, bills, and such. He sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the son. Cragen tells them he wants to reconstruct the family's affairs.Munch and Cassidy question 'Bull Dozier' (the guy in the photo) while he loads a moving van. He tells them he ended his relationship with Andrew when he did not pay for the last 7 dinners, all he wanted was sex and they both wanted to be on top. He shows them the bondage paraphernalia Andrew loaned him and asked if his wife wanted them returned. Munch told him she probably will not miss them.When Benson and Stabler talk with Adam, they learn the trip with his mother was enough for him to last for three years. He informs them he had a good relationship with his father until he started sleeping with his girlfriends. The last one being Becky Sorenson. When they talk with Sorenson, she sounds like Andrew was God's gift to women. She tells them the relationship only lasted two weeks, but ended on a good note. When they show her pictures of men Andrew had been with, she recognizes Charlie, the one with the boat. Charlie tries to deny the relationship, but finally concedes that he let Andrew have sex with him in exchange for help with his child's tuition for school. He is shocked to learn he was not the only guy Andrew had been with like he had been told.In the team meeting, Benson and Stabler inform them Andrew had no angry break ups and no one with a motive. Munch informs them he spent more money on girls than boys. Jeffries tells them a fingerprint lifted from the scene belongs to Sonya Pietrovicz. She has been in the states for 3 years and lists her occupation in Russian, but it translates as 'hooker'.Benson and Stabler go to The Turkish Baths in search of Sonya. They are told she left a few weeks prior to be with Victor, who owns Ecstacy. He also explains that in Russia hookers are at the top of the social scene. They rarely fall in love. In America, girls fall in love so easily. When they see a guy in the Jacuzzi, Benson and Stabler recognize him but cannot place him.At Ecstasy Spa, Benson and Stabler learn Sonya no longer works there, but her friend Natasha does. Natasha tells Benson about Sonya's new boyfriend Yuri. She also tells her they are not friends any more because she met too many men. Natasha and Sonya auditioned for the same singing job. Natasha believes Sonya only got the job because she was sleeping with Yuri.Benson and Stabler talk with Sonya after a performance. When they tell her fingerprints were fond on the bondage supplies used to kill Harlin belong to her, she tells them she cleaned his house as a favor to her friend Katya, who is on vacation. When they threaten to arrest her, she says she thinks Katya slept with Andrew once. They tell her to get word to Katya that they want to talk to her.While they are sitting around the squad room discussing Russia and women, Jeffries answers a call. When she hangs up, she tells the team that it was Harlin's housekeeper who is not on vacation and her name is not Katya. They decide to bring Sonya in for questioning. She informs them it is exciting to do something forbidden. And her job is forbidden. She tells them her only commitment is to her friends. After she denies knowing the identity of Katya's boyfriend, Cragen interrupts them to tell Stabler Emily needs to speak with him. Emily tells him she retrieved her father's personal papers from his hiding place. Among the papers were some legal papers telling of a lawsuit he had going against Katya. When Stabler informs Cragen Andrew was suing Katya for $2 million, Cragen tells them that was a good motive. Benson tells him that was the value of the gifts Katya kept. Stabler informs him the lawsuit was dropped the day after Andrew died. Emily also told him her mother may know where Katya is because she used to hear her parents arguing over Andrew paying for her apartment. Cragen sends them on their way to talk to the widow.Mrs. Harlin says she believed they already knew about the suit. She also tells Benson and Stabler she is sure there were more Russians that Andrew slept with. Adam interrupts to tell them he told his mother to drop the lawsuit. When they ask her if she has an address for Katya, she tells them to ask her lawyer.Someone calls Cragen speaking Russian so he gets Munch to take the call. Munch tells Cragen and Cassidy it was Sonya, she said she was on Brighten Beach, and she sounded scared. When they get to the apartment building an elderly lady is scrubbing the stairs. When they open the door, they see Sonya and another woman laying dead on the floor.Benson and Stabler join Cassidy and Munch outside the apartment building. A uniform officer brings a Russian man over to them and says he is Sonya's cousin. While the guy speaks in Russian, Munch relays to the others that he is inviting them to his restaurant to drink and talk. At the restaurant, he tells them the other woman was Sonya's aunt. He shows them a picture of Sonya and her friends. When they show him a picture of a guy, he tells them they do not bring their American boyfriends around him.While they are talking about a possible motive for the deaths of these women, they are interrupted by Alexander Strizhov. He tells them there is no need to find Katya because he killed Harlin. He tells them he was shot, but he was not murdered that way. When told about Sonya's death, he is shocked by the news, but he keeps telling them to arrest him. Cragen, Benson, and Stabler decide he is lying possibly to cover for Katya. They decide to go look for Katya at her apartment.The doorman tells them she left an hour prior in her car service very dressed up. When they finally locate her, she comes on to Stabler. He informs her Sonya is dead, but she already knows. She believes she should go on with her life. When they ask her to join them at the station, she tells them unless she is under arrest she will not go. They agree to let her come to the station at 9AM, but if she does not show they promise to have immigration show up at 9:05.The next morning, they inform Katya Alexander confessed to Andrew's murder. She tells them they went to Andrew's to tease him. She told him she left him because she caught him with two men. She denies killing Andrew, but admits to putting the banana in his tailpipe.When they update Cragen on their interview with Katya, Stabler guesses that since Harlin liked living on the edge that may have included sleeping with a mobster's girlfriend. Cragen sends them to Sonya's boyfriend's restaurant.When they get there, they are invited to join the table of Sonya's boyfriend. When Benson refuses to dance, she is told she must wait. Stabler is told Sonya made bad choices when it came to the men she chose to hang around with, like Alexander. When Stabler asks if he is trying to say Alex killed her or Andrew, he says they are just having a friendly conversation.While Munch and Cassidy are questioning the locals at Brighton Beach, they see Sonya's cousin. He is drunk and speaking English. He tells them he heard an argument between Sonya and Alex. He hears banging around and then Alex kills her.Stabler informs Katya that they know Alex killed Sonya and they think he killed Andrew. Stabler tells her Sonya and Alex were sleeping together. She tells him that she and Alex used to sleep together. Benson asks to speak with her alone. When Stabler leaves, Benson tells her it would be easy to convict her of Andrew's murder. Benson tells her if she is not guilty, then help them convict Alex. When she tells Benson she is too busy, Benson asks her if she is a sex machine with a cash register between her legs or if she is too scared to get involved. When Benson tells her the prisons in America are no different than the ones in Russia, Katya does not believe her. When she starts to place her under arrest, Katya agrees to help set up a sting for Alex. When they rush the restaurant, Alex empties the gun he has of all but one bullet. He decides to play Russian Roulette while he tells them a Russian Love Poem which is the story of his crime. When he says he is lucky, he pulls the trigger again and shoots himself. Benson and Stabler take a few minutes to look out at the water before deciding to go home. As they walk toward the city, they try to make sense of the tragedy."

      "corpus": "Benson and Stabler are greeted by a uniform officer telling them the dead victim's privates were exposed causing them to be called in. The officer identifies the victim as Seth Langdon, the only occupant of a two bedroom on the sixth floor of the building. He explains Seth is the son William H. Langdon, head of the Moral Coalition. He reminds them Seth's father preaches about good clean living and believes homosexuality can be cured.Munch walks in to the team filling out forms for new medical coverage. As he rants about the invasion of privacy, he passes Benson's desk. He tells everyone she has the right idea by leaving the father's section blank causing Stabler to tell him to keep his eyes on his own paper. Cragen breaks it up by asking for information on the case. Benson and Stabler explain the white victim was 21-year-old Seth Langdon who was a resident attending a party in the building until he went to the roof around 1AM. They explain seminal fluids were found on the body and his genitals were left exposed. He was badly beaten culminating in his head being hit against the AC unit. Munch guesses lover's quarrel. Jeffries guesses it was a sexual predator from the party. Cassidy informs them the ME found two sets of DNA...the victim and the doer. Cragen tells them to start working their way through the guest list. When Munch notices the victim's name, he starts talking about William H. Langdon, but it interrupted by Stabler informing him of the victim's relationship to him. When Cassidy expresses his disbelief, Cragen informs them one out of ten men are gay and tells them to see how he felt about it hitting that close to home. Once Stabler sees Cragen leave, he approaches Munch at the coffee pot. Stabler warns him about comments about Benson's father before explaining her father was the man who raped her mother.Benson and Stabler arrive to see William H. Langdon, but are stopped by Steven Hale only to be allowed in when Mr. Langdon sees them. He denies his son's homosexuality saying they had it under control. When he says homosexuality is a crime against God, Stabler asks if AIDS is divine retribution. Benson explains their only agenda is to find his son's killer. Mr. Langdon explains his son went through sexual rehabilitation centers and completed it two months prior.When Munch and Cassidy question the hosts of the party, they are told the party goers were of the elite. They tell them the party was a civilized gathering. Seth arrived with a blond gentleman, but after a few drinks his date wanted to leave. They exchanged words in the hallway before Seth returned alone, retrieved another drink, and went to the balcony. Benson and Stabler speak with Lorraine Hansen. She tells them she heard yelling from the roof before a beer bottle came crashing to the sidewalk. When her husband, Jesse, arrives, he tells them he went to tell the party hosts to turn the music down. Lorraine tells them she saw a blonde guy getting into a chauffeur driven Lincoln Town car.In the squad room, Munch approaches Benson as she is inputting the party guests into the computer. He explains he did not know about her father. She tells him Stabler and Cragen are the only ones to know and she does not want anyone else to find out. He promises to keep his mouth shut before asking if they ever caught him. After she tells him no, he offers her his ear if she ever needs to talk. Stabler interrupts them explaining the car service used at Seth's building told him the occupant Steven Hale was dropped of at a brownstone in the Upper East Side.As Benson and Stabler approach Hale outside his home, they ask if Mr. Langdon knew what he did to his son. They are interrupted by his wife and son coming down the stairs.In the squad room while they watch Steven Hale stew in the interrogation room, Munch questions why a gay man would work for Mr. Langdon. After Stabler explains the witnesses saw Hale get jealous when he saw Seth hitting on other guys, Benson wonders if Hale thought that by working for Langdon would cure him of his homosexuality. Stabler adds the example of Mr. Langdon believing Camp Wild Bunch could cure Seth. Stabler and Benson question how educated people could think people would choose family rejection and discrimination and heartache to be gay. Munch tells them one of the treatments at the sexual rehabilitation places is electroshock therapy to the groin. Benson brings them back to Hale pointing out he is fuming. Stabler reminds her they just caught him in the lie he has been living so of course he will be mad. When Munch points out Hale is mad at them, they explain that is why they want him to speak with him since he is so smart and patient.Before Munch can say a word, Hale tells him he is not a homosexual. He explains his job is to keep an eye on Seth since his father is considering a run for Congress and an openly homosexual son could ruin it like Newt's lesbian sister did him. Munch clarifies Newt's sister was actually his half-sister before asking him if he thinks Newt's problems could have anything to do with his ethics violations. While he is ranting, Cragen calls for Cassidy to take over. Hale explains to Cassidy he followed Seth to the party. He was upset by Seth's flirting because he found it revolting. He further explains the statement 'Stay out of my life' was a message Seth wanted Hale to deliver to his father.After explaining Hale's wife alibi's him after 12:30AM and Seth's journal confirms he was not involved with Hale, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler to send Hale home with their apologies. When Stabler explains he checked the guest list with Seth's journal and found nothing, Cragen looks at the list noting it contained assemblymen, people from the social register, and a major AIDS fund-raiser. He tells them to check them all regardless of social standing. Jeffries and Cassidy interrupt Andre Lasnik's rehearsal stating they are investigating a homicide. After explaining he left the party after one, he told them when Seth came on to him he excused himself to the restroom. He informs them Assemblyman Rossi's boyfriend, Joe Bandolini, had a camcorder at the party.Benson and Stabler approach Officer Bandolini's patrol car asking to speak to him in private. Once out of earshot of his partner, Bandolini informs them he knows they want to talk about the Langdon case. He tells them his tape was made of the party, not the murder. He assures them it contains nothing relevant to the case. They promise they will keep his reputation intact. When they ask if they can see it to make sure it does not have any leads for them, he tells them he will bring it to their squad room in the morning.Munch goes to the 55th precinct and speaks with a detective who worked with Conklin. The detective explains Conklin kept most of his notes in his head. Upon glancing through Conklin's notebook, he sees the notes on Serena Benson's case and asks what 'C.K'. stood for. The detective explains that it was '68 so it was Carl Kudlak. He further explains they pulled him in on a lot of cases then but could not nail him on any until his wife killed herself in '72 taking his alibi with her. Stabler reports to Cragen's office upon his request. Cragen introduces him to Mr. Shore, Bandolini's GOAL representative. After Stabler questions involving the Gay Officer's Action League, Mr. Shore explains that since he and Benson harassed the officer then they must step in. Stabler explains they did not harass him, but asked for a tape they may need in their case. Mr. Shore claims they threatened Bandolini with legal action and public humiliation. When Cragen tries to calm the situation saying they can work this out, Mr. Shore explains he has seen the tape and agrees with Bandolini saying it does not contain anything they may need. He further explains that if Bandolini is outed by accident or on purpose they will be slapped with a defamation suit. Before he leaves, Mr. Shore hands Cragen an injunction barring them from seizing the tape. Cragen tells Stabler to get Benson in there.Munch tells Benson he had some free time and pulled her mother's case. While she tries to explain she has pulled everything there is to pull, he hands her a file and tells her she would not have been able to pull this. He explains this guy looked good for her mother's rape. Stabler interrupts them asking Munch if he is bothering his partner. They both deny he is bothering her as she puts the file in a drawer and returns to work.When Forensics tells Benson and Stabler they ran the quickest DNA tests available and got a hit, Stabler demands a name. After she tells him it will not hold up in court, she gives them the name Ray Gunther. Stabler wonders where he knows the name from. Benson explains they studied about him in the academy. She reminds him Gunther went around terrorizing women in the early '80s and was tagged 'The Parkway Rapist'.In the squad room, Jeffries goes off about Gunther being let out. Stabler informs them if Gunther escaped then he took the entire administrative staff of Sing-Sing with him because she has been on hold for ten minutes. They are interrupted when Cragen comes out of his office to explain Gunther was paroled one month prior after serving 15 of his 25-year term citing the overcrowding in the prisons as the reason for letting him out early. When Benson and Jeffries express their distaste of the decision to let this guy out, Stabler attempts to calm them reminding them he had to register. Cragen tells him his address is in Seth's building. When Benson and Stabler knock on the door where Gunther is supposed to be staying, Jesse Hansen answers. Benson tells them they are close when Lorraine asks if they found the guy that killed Seth. When they are told Ray Gunther gave that address when he was paroled, Jesse explains Ray is his brother.In the interrogation room, Benson and Stabler asks if Jesse changed his name because Gunther was not a popular name in his neighborhood. He tells them people gave him a hard time about his name. He denies knowing where Ray is.Lorraine explains to Munch and Cassidy that Jesse will never talk about Ray. When Ray was on trial, reporters came to his high school and Jesse told them Ray should be put to death. Because of this Jesse allowed him to stay with them after he got out, but she kicked him out after the first week. She tells them Ray was in their apartment until 1AM. He may be with Cindy Stocklash who will only stay at hotels with porn.Benson listens to the tape of her mother's statement while looking over the file and pictures. Serena explains she was on her way home from the campus library after it closed when she was knocked unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she was on a landing below street level and a man was on top of her. The only thing she could remember was he had sideburns. Benson stopped the tape when a car horn honked startling her.Munch and Cassidy approach the hotel room and hear moans and groans. They chuckle before knocking. When they receive a response, Munch announces they are detectives. They hear noises causing Cassidy to ask if everything is okay. As Ray climbs out the back window, he is apprehended by Benson and Stabler, who escort him to their car. They explain he is under arrest for Seth's murder. When he tells them they do not have proof, they inform him he left evidence in his mouth. The team explains he will look right for it with the jury. Out for one month and he is back to his old tricks changing from highways to rooftops, but using the same amount of excessive force. When Benson asks if he liked his victims puny, Ray asks if she is jealous. Stabler reacts to Ray's use of the word 'sweetheart' by squeezing the cuffs and bringing Ray to the ground while he reminds Ray her name is Detective Benson and demands an apology. Benson helps Stabler get him back to his feet and tells him she does not need an apology from him.When Cragen pulls Benson and Stabler into his office, Stabler begins his explanation of his treatment of Gunther. Cragen stops him to ask what he is talking about, but Benson cuts in inquiring as to what he wanted. Cragen informs them the DNA does not belong to Ray Gunther. When they arrive at the Forensics Lab, they are reminded they were told the results would not hold up in court. She goes on to explain that while the DNA did not belong to Ray, it does belong to a family member.Stabler enters the interrogation room telling Jesse the DNA lets Ray off the hook. They tell him a DNA sample could clear his name. He tells them he should call a lawyer, but they tell him he is free to go.Cassidy informs Jeffries and Munch that they had Ray dead to rights when he was tried before. Ray got on the stand and told the court he was abused by his father. When they called Jesse to the stand, Jesse denied it. Cragen tells Benson and Stabler they will get his DNA. When Cragen asks what they have, Jeffries tells him a piss poor gene pool. Stabler tells them your behavior is not predetermined. Cassidy tells them of twins being raised totally different, but turn out committing the same crime. Cragen informs them they have shown by transferring genes from one species to another can alter behavior. Stabler reminds them they are humans and it comes down to how you are raised. Benson gets upset and walks away. Stabler follows her wanting to see if anything is wrong. She tells him the only way Jesse and Ray make sense is if they are fruit from the same poisonous tree. When he questions if she truly believes that, she walks away from him.When ADA Carmichael brings up the fact Forensics led them to Jesse's brother first, Benson and Stabler explain it was because it was the same bloodline. She tells them they are asking if they are going to test everyone in the family. Benson tells her just the one who lives in the victim's building. Cragen clarifies another piece of evidence they have is tied up in litigation, but he will try to get it untied.Cragen meets Bandolini on a bench in town. He makes sure the officer knows they need the tape, but the officer makes sure he knows what it could do to him. After Cragen tells him a golf story and asks him how he is sleeping, Bandolini hands him the tape assuring him there is nothing illegal on the tape.Upon viewing the tape, Munch gives the tech a few instructions and locates Jesse not entering. After a few more instructions, they locate Ray. Stabler decides they need to talk to Lorraine again for clarification on when they each returned.  Stabler explains to Lorraine that providing a false alibi for someone is a felony. She denies Jesse's involvement explaining Ray has been hell-bent on ruining Jesse's life. She explains what she had told them was accurate, but after Jesse came home Ray took him back out. She tells them he did not return until two.Ray tells Benson and Stabler his involvement was a joke. He kept telling Jesse that Seth was his girlfriend. He also explains he would do the flirting with Seth for Jesse. When Jesse left, he told Seth to go on the roof and Jesse would be up there. Ray then explains that if Jesse had told the truth at his trial then he would have only received five years. Before they leave, Ray gloats that they cannot pin any of this on him no matter how much they want to. Benson and Stabler tell Jesse Ray told them everything. Jesse explains Ray told the truth at his trial, but he wanted to forget it all. He tells them Ray would tell him he would end up in jail. He does not remember how he got on the roof. He remembers someone was on their knees and his pants were down. Jesse tells them he could hear Ray laughing at him from the door. He tells them he thought he was killing Ray. When Seth was dead, Ray told him, 'Welcome to the family'. ADA Carmichael tells Cragen they can charge Ray with inciting a murder, depraved indifference, and accessory to start. She tells him with Ray's priors he will do more time than Jesse.When Stabler tries to explain Jesse did what he did not because it was in his blood, but because he believed it would. She retrieves a file from her desk saying there is something she needs to do. When he asks what good it will do for her to know, she just looks at him. Benson walks to where she can see the old man at the window. After looking for a few moments, she returns to the car saying she is positive he is not her father."

      "corpus": "A freshly showered and smoking Harper Anderson calls 911 telling the operator she has been raped. While Cassidy and Benson are in bed together, her pager goes off alerting her it is time for her to go to work. As she walks into the other room, Cassidy tells her the sex was incredible. Her only response was for him to not get used to it.When Benson arrives at the hospital, she must give a description of the rape victim she needs to see. Harper overhears the conversation and speaks up. Harper informs her she sent the uniform officer to the cafeteria because he was getting on her nerves. Benson explains she needs a description of the attack before they can do the rape exam. Harper tells her the perp grabbed her ankles and wrists before hitting her in the face. After penetrating her vaginally, he ejaculated on her stomach only to wipe it off with one of her t-shirts. He made her shower. Benson excuses herself to approach a nearby doctor. She informs him that since the victims from the car wreck are stable then he will do a rape exam next. As they near the end of the exam, Benson goes through the checklist of evidence needed. When Benson tells the doctor they need to do a UV on her stomach to check for fluids, he informs her the hospital does not have one. Benson concedes that it would not do any good since he made her shower after Harper groans. The doctor gives her a high dose contraceptive telling her to take two more in twelve hours. He informs her the STD test results will be back in 24 hours, but she will need to retest in three and six months. When she asks what is next, Benson tells her they can go to the station so she can give her formal statement if she is up to it. In the hallway, the doctor tells Stabler to perp used as little force as possible and made sure to erase as much of the DNA as possible. When they are interrupted by a uniform officer asking if they heard about the rape victim causing the doctor to leave. When Stabler confirms his suspicion this was the officer who left the victim alone, he tells him to never leave a rape victim alone. The officer tells him the crime scene is secure, but they still need to know what to look for. Stabler tells him they are about to go find out before making sure he can handle voucher the rape kit.At the station, Harper tells Benson and Stabler what happened. She wore earplugs because of the street fair on her street. She woke up to a man holding her shirt. He held her legs closed by jamming his knees on either side of her. He pulled her nightgown up shielding her face and capturing her arms. When she jerked away at his attempt to kiss her, he hit her in the face. He unzipped his pants, thrusts hard five times, and asked, 'Is this how you like it?' He ejaculated on her stomach, wiped it off with her shirt, and told her to take a shower adding 'Please'. He made sure the water temperature was right before taking her gown off so she could see to get in the shower. He carefully washed her completely, handed her a towel and her robe before telling her to get on the floor and count to twenty. He even told her he was not going to insult her by asking her not to call the police. She describes the perp as being tall, thin, white, sandy hair, cold eyes, and he was about her age. She informs them nothing out of the ordinary had happened to tip her off that this may happen. He was not nervous. He smelled like expensive, subtle cologne. She tells them she is positive she can identify the perp in a line-up. She draws a picture of the ring he stole explaining it is platinum, rare, and belonged to her grandmother. He also stole her wallet and the t-shirt he used to clean her off. When Benson takes her to her boyfriend's apartment, she explains a locksmith will change the locks in her apartment and a counselor will call her to set up an appointment. Giving her a business card with her pager number on it, she tells Harper to call her anytime. Before she walks away, they exchange a smile.Benson notices Cassidy's presence as soon as she enters Harper's apartment. Stabler quickly explains he called him in case she stayed longer with Harper. After they inform her they did not find any prints, Cassidy informs her the perp came in through the window. Stabler shows her the lock on the window has been broken for a while. He further explains the perp came in and saw her sleeping before heading over to the dresser where he takes the t-shirt and her wallet...but who smoked the joint? He immobilizes her, rapes her, and takes her ring. Since they did not find underwear, they assume the perp took them as a trophy. He takes her to the shower. Benson notes the wet shower curtain while Cassidy says the soap is not wet leading him to believe she staged the whole thing. Upon seeing the curling iron on the floor, he demonstrates it could have been the gun used. Stabler questions the lack of evidence while Cassidy believes Harper was paranoid. When Benson asks Cassidy is he wants to hear that she said it never happened, he responds that maybe that is the truth.Cragen interrupts a discussion between Cassidy and Benson to get the team update going. When Stabler informs them the perp gained access to the apartment using the fire escape at the window, they agree it must have been a stranger and rule out the tenants of the building. There were no fingerprints or DNA evidence. After Benson relays the description of the perp, Stabler adds since she was hit on the left side of the face then he must be right-handed. Cragen comes to the realization the perp is not a junkie because of the cologne he wears. Since he took the time to make sure there was not any evidence, they conclude the attack was planned. The decide to rule out the Upper West Side perp since this one talked to his victim. Stabler explains the perp asked  Harper 'Is this how you like it?' and said  'Please' making the perp think he was being a gentleman. After Cragen remembers the street fair going on where Harper lived, Cassidy tells him her will check out the vendors. Munch says he will check the pawn shops for the leafy ring. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to ask Harper about the joint and to question Harper's neighbors.When they arrive at Benji Dowe's apartment looking for Harper, Benson informs him that Harper needs his unconditional love and acceptance. Dowe informs them Harper went to work after not being able to sleep. Upon meeting up with Harper at Le Poeme, Harper questions  Benson and Stabler's reasoning for asking about the joint. After they tell her it is a routine question, she reminds them nothing about that night was routine for her.  The superintendent of Harper's building tells Benson and Stabler there have not been any break-ins or unusual people around the building. He tells them he will ask the tenants and he may lose some over the attack. One of the tenants sitting at her window informs them of a 'Peeping Tom' in the building across the street. Benson and Stabler find the 'Peeping Tom,' Sam Lardner, has three charges of assault on his record. Stabler wonders if this makes number four. At first when asked about Harper, he tells them he denies knowing her. After describing the apartment was and telling him the wrong apartment, he quickly corrects the mistake. Lardner informs him he saw the entire rape before telling them everything that happened. He also gives them the information that Harper does not wear underwear to bed, but tells them he did not see the guy's face because he was too busy looking at Harper.In the squad room, Jeffries informs Benson and Stabler she checked Harper's usual places and found several attacks. While Jeffries is telling them none of the MO's matched, Cragen interrupts them asking if Harper would buy $500 of meats at one time. After they tell him someone is using her credit card, he informs them Munch and Cassidy are transporting him from the 27th Precinct. As they escort the perp in, Cassidy stops Benson to return the watch she left at his apartment and to ask he rout again. When she turns him down, he believes she was only refusing because of the incident at Harper's apartment. Before the conversation is over, she informs him the night was a one time only occasion. While Benson and Stabler are at their lockers, Stabler asks about her relationship with Cassidy. After initially denying it, she tells him she broke a personal rule and now she is paying the price for it because Cassidy wants to see her again. He reminds her he is her partner for better or worse and advises her to be over nice to Cassidy and he will get over it.Before going into the interrogation room, Benson, Stabler, and Cragen discuss the perp's rap sheet. His robbery charges escalates from shoplifting to breaking and entering to rape. Stabler guesses he escalated out of boredom or the opportunity arose. Benson informs him Harper is on her way to make a positive identification since he matches the description of her attacker.After making the perp account for his morning, Benson and Stabler question him about how he used his time the night before. He informs them he was in a holding cell after jumping a turn  While Stabler works on his computer, Benson looks at a print out of arraignments and tells Cragen the guy is not on the list. After asking when she got the print out, Cragen reminds them the list is only updated once a day. Stabler quickly types on the computer and locates the newly posted arraignment. Cragen excuses himself to work on paperwork before Harper comes into the squad room. Benson approaches her stating they did not have the perp after all. She retrieves Harper's new apartment keys from her desk and gives them to her. Six months later. When Cassidy sees Benson getting ready for a date, he reminds her she was not ready for a relationship six months ago. She reminds him that falling for someone you work with is not a smart choice. He tells her that if she still works there when she gets married, then her marriage will be an affair because she is married to the job. They are interrupted when Cragen calls Benson into his office. When Benson enters the office, Cragen introduces her to Detective Halligan from Robbery. Cragen relays to her the details of a 4-day-old robbery case. He explains the perp entered the apartment through the window while he was wearing a mask. The perp was using a gun, being polite, and the victim had a gun under her mattress. When she flipped the light on, the gun he had was a curling iron. Benson informs Halligan of Harper's case. Halligan tells her the guy limped away after the victim froze up. After glancing over the file, Benson tells them she believes this is Harper's guy. Cragen tells her to interview Jane Tyler to make sure the MO matches before she does anything else. When he tells her it can wait, she tells him she doubts Jane is sleeping and leaves.While Jane tells Benson what happened to her, she adds the perp stole her father's watch. The watch had 'Leo' inscribed on the back. She also tells her he raped her. After talking a little longer, Benson draws the similarities with Harper's attack. Jane explains she did not tell the police everything because she wanted them out of her apartment. Benson tells her she did the one thing she was suppose to do...survive.Stabler questions the address of the suspect as they arrive. Mrs. Cleary answers the door and calls for her husband when asked. Benson promptly notices Harper's ring her finger drawing Stabler's attention to it as well. They escort Cleary to the precinct to question him.Cleary explains his limp is due to an accidental step off of the curb. He states he was on Lennox Street clearing his head over some stressful clients. His wife buys his cologne so he does not know the name of it. He bought the ring off of the street from a guy named T.J. After he says his watch has been in the family for years, Benson asks to see it. She immediately looks on the back to see 'Leo'. When she asks who Leo is, he states it is his astrological sign. He tells them T.J. can be found between Canal and Mott. Stabler explains Canal and Mott intersect so you cannot be between the two, but to help him understand he asks Cleary to draw a diagram showing T.J.'s location.While updating Cragen on the case, Benson informs him Cleary smells expensive. Cragen mocks her saying the jury should smell the defendant. After Stabler laughs at the comment, he explains not many perps shop for expensive cologne and the watch and ring are trophies from the rapes. Cragen reminds them they will not reopen Jane's case. Cragen informs them they can get Cleary on possession of stolen property, but they need Harper to identify the ring. Benson tells him Harper said she could identify her rapist as well. Cragen reminds them they have until 9AM to get him arraigned.When they arrive at Harper's apartment, the superintendent answers the door explaining Harper never stayed there again. He tells them he knew he would not be able to rent the apartment to anyone else so he moved into it. He informs them she moved out so fast he still has her deposit.   When they check with Dowe, he tells them Harper stopped eating. She could not sleep unless the lights were on, which meant he could not sleep. She worked out like a fiend. She started dressing differently and even wore her tennis shoes to bed. After he tells them she broke up with him three months prior, he explains Harper changed addresses, changed jobs, and created a whole new Harper.They finally arrive at Harper's apartment. She tells them to never come back and slams the door in their faces.In Cragen's office, he explains to ADA Carmichael Cleary's wife keeps saying Cleary sleeps through the night. Benson asks if they can get a search warrant to look for other trophies in Cleary's home. She is reminded they only have one victim. When she asks about using some law Harper has broken to compel her to talk, ADA Carmichael explains she is not going to rape her a second time. ADA Carmichael tells her she will have to use her own powers of persuasion with Harper. After ADA Carmichael leaves, Cragen informs Benson that Stabler is digging up anything he can on Cleary and Munch is working on Cleary's lawyer. He tells her to take Cassidy with a photo array and show it to Harper. Before she gets out the door, he reminds her they only have a few hours left before they must let Cleary go. While Cleary tries to explain aggressive accounting to Munch, Stabler comes in to explain Cleary is a Cancer not a Leo. He tells him Leo was a nickname of his grandfather's. Stabler questions that considering his grandfather's name was Percy. When Cleary tries to continue his explanation with Munch, Stabler tries to ask Cleary if he gets to Tribeca a lot before being cut off by Cleary's lawyer telling him he does not have to answer that. After Stabler is told Cleary can only answer questions about what is public record, Cleary's lawyer asks what he is being charged with. Munch responds telling Stabler he does not have to answer that.When Harper refuses to answer her door, Benson tells her she is just as stubborn as she is causing Harper to answer the door. Benson and Cassidy explain her attacker has attacked again and she is the only one who can identify him. Harper tells them she did everything she could and she is over it. When Harper walks away, Cassidy regains her attention when he tells Benson that maybe the guy they have did not do her. Harper turns around and corrects his statement angrily. Benson cuts in reminding Harper she is still sleeping in her tennis shoes so she is not over it. She informs her '[c]losure is a myth'. Benson explains people change everyday and you can accept them or fight them. When Harper refuses to come in to help herself, Benson asks her to come for them promising she will be there with her. At the precinct, Harper is unable to identify her rapist even after they all say, 'Is this how you like it?' Benson takes her back to her desk and shows her the ring. Benson informs her they retrieved it from a man she could not identify. Harper breaks down realizing she really could not identify her rapist. She explains believed since her mother died a long, horrible death that nothing else bad could ever happen to her."

      "corpus": "When Benson and Stabler arrive at the crime scene, they see a woman hanging from a rope anchored to the ceiling fan. They are informed the first thought was the victim, Layla Briggs, killed herself. They are assured they were notified as soon as the cause of death became questionable. While the team is discussing the link between tattoos and S&M, Cragen questions Benson's leaving part of her report blank. She informs him the first cause of death was suicide, but it did not add up. Stabler tells him the ME on the scene was a rookie and he disturbed the scene so they still need more information. He also suggests this may be a case of rough sex going too far. Benson tells them she was pierced from head to toe and she was a financial analyst. After Munch goes off on a rant about the link between high finance and S&M, Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the family while Munch and Cassidy check out her place of employment.Anne Briggs tells Benson and Stabler that Layla's father died when she was fifteen and since then they had drifted apart. Shortly after his death, she saw Layla had pierced both of her nipples. She decided that she may make it worse if she threw a fit about it so she never said anything. Layla kept her at arm's length never speaking  about anything personal. She last spoke with Layla a week prior and she was happy.Amy, the office manager where Layla worked, explained Layla's job to Munch and Cassidy. She explained even though Layla handled billions of dollars, she was well liked by all. She tells them Sho-Ling Fu had the most contact with Layla, but she is not in. When they ask for contact information for her, Amy tells them they frown on incoming personal calls. Munch explains the police frown on obstruction of justice.Rodgers confirms the cause of death is from a ligature around the neck. She refuses to declare homicide or suicide until Benson and Stabler give her some information. When Stabler questions whether the fatal injury was self-inflicted, Rodgers explains the robe she was wearing was clean meaning someone redressed her and that is the pattern of behavior for family.Benson and Stabler talk with Mrs. Briggs to see if maybe she found Layla. Stabler explains Layla may have been experimenting sexually. Benson tells her if that was the case her death could be an accident. Stabler pleads with her to help them. Mrs. Briggs explains she found Layla dressed in leather, she changed her, then called the police. She tells them she threw the stuff away in the dumpster in a blue plastic bag. Forensics shows Benson and Stabler the outfit Layla was wearing. Semen was found in the right places. He explains that even though there was a whip it was not used. When they heard the rattling from the end of the whip, they open it to find diamonds.As Munch is telling the team the cause of death was auto erotic asphyxiation, or terminal sex, Stabler and Benson interrupt to tell them the victim had a partner. When Stabler tells them they found half a million dollars in diamonds, Cragen sends them out to find out where it came from. Before they leave Stabler hands Cragen a file containing the victims credit card statements detailing which sex fetish shops she frequented. Cragen hands the file to Cassidy and Munch with orders to see if they can identify any of her partners.Munch and Cassidy find the clerk at a fetish shop explained to Layla about code words and general safety practices. The clerk also told them Layla came in with her boss's brunette girlfriend.Benson and Stabler learn only dealers and thieves deal in high quantities of diamonds, because diamonds are untraceable. They are sent to a dealer who will sell to anyone, David McKuin. He acknowledges he sold Layla 9,416,000 for her work. He tells them she wanted 10 million but he did not have that much. She paid with a corporate check from Martin Global signed by Sho-Ling Fu. Stabler tells him if anyone tries to fence a large quantity of diamonds to call him.When they arrive at Martin Global, Stabler informs Benson that Munch just informed him Martin has two stunning girlfriends. They first speak with Sho-Ling Fu. She tells them Layla sometimes dealt with the delivery of actual goods, but she does not know where the diamonds in question are. Their next stop is Mr. Martin's office where they find him working on repairing a computer. When they inform him Layla had purchased sex stuff on the corporate credit card, he compares it to financing a drinking habit. He explains the diamonds as a financial move and anyone who knows how to read the financial report would know she had the diamonds. He tells them everyone in the office has access to the report as well as the New Vision Endowment.At the New Vision Endowment, they learn the endowment was constantly put at risk. They were also told Frank Martin was given power of attorney and if anything happened he would cover them. They return to Martin to discuss this new information with him. He tells them it was a financial move. He tells them Layla made millions working for him and she did not have a reason to steal anything. He does not know of her having any problems with him, nor does he know who she is dating.When Cragen asks for an update, Benson and Stabler inform him Layla purchased sex toys with corporate credit cards and everyone knew about it. They also tell him she was a financial whiz and managed a fund for a charity. Cragen tells them a charity's financial records are public record and he wants to know what they were really doing with it.After looking at the financial records they notice only $1 million of the $18 million taken in actually went for charity. When they confront David Kelp, the director of the charity, they explain they believe Layla embezzles the money, he signs the reports, and Layla got greedy. He tells them he and Layla knew each other because of their compulsions and he was threatened to keep quiet about the financial irregularities or she would expose his. He tells them Anna Foust knew Layla real well.Foust tells them Layla and Frank Martin were banished from her parties because Frank hurt one of the girls. She agrees to tell them the identity of the girl only if they agree to punish him.When Cragen talks to the girl, she tells him Martin threatened to turn her into Immigration unless she played some games with him. Martin wanted to try choking her. He promised her it would be okay. He wrapped a belt around her neck until she passed out. When she came to, he was gone.When the team goes to search Martin's office, they walk in to a pile of shredded documents and nothing else. Cragen informs the team the FBI is only interested in the financial side of things. When he asks for ideas on how to find him, Benson suggests to follow the money, which happens to be $9 million in diamonds. Cragen tells them to check the diamond district. Jeffries comes in loaded down with files and tells them she found out the Tennessee Department of Commerce is investigating him. They even went so far as to send an investigator to New York.The investigator, Tucker,  informs Benson and Stabler everything Martin does is barely legitimate. After five months of investigating, he has found aggressive maneuvers, but nothing solid. He gives them all of the contacts he knows of. As they leave Benson tells him Munch just told her McKuin received a call from a woman wanting to unload a bunch of diamonds. Munch acts as a diamond dealer when Sho-Ling Fu shows up to get rid of the diamonds. Munch and Cassidy escort her to the station for further questioning, but she refuses to talk. While Munch and Cassidy are doing all of the talking, Munch looks in her calendar to find she had lots of date with David Kelp. Munch bails to go see his Phrenologist. When Stabler and Benson go to speak with Kelp, they find his body. They return to the station to talk to Sho-Ling Fu. They inform her Kelp had a bullet hole through his head. She tells them Martin told her to cash the diamonds out and if she went to the cops or did not return, he would kill Kelp. She tells them where to find Martin. When they go to the location to bust Martin, they bust the door in and find Tucker.Benson and Stabler question Tucker about Martin's location. He denies knowing where Martin is, but when they threaten to charge him with Layla's murder, he tells them Martin left an hour before they arrived. When they ask him what happened with Layla, he tells them he does not know specifics. Martin called him and when he arrived Martin already had her strung up. He expected to join Martin and Layla in another erotic sex night. He tells them in return he got cash, cars, and free time. He refused to help Martin cover it up, but he gave him diamonds to shut him up. The only person Martin still trusted was Amy. When they get to her place, they find her badly beaten up. She tells them Martin beat her when she told him she did not have any money, but he located an old airline ticket. He forced her to call the airline and tell them she was an invalid and her friend was coming to change the ticket.Benson and Stabler meet up with Martin at the ticket counter when the ticket agent has problems getting his card to go through. They give him a lift to the station. They claim they are waiting to make sure he is authorized to use the platinum card. They tell him they are investigative bean counters. When they begin asking questions about what Tucker had told them, Martin is reduced to asking one word questions before asking for his lawyer.Amy tells Cragen she met Martin in a bar she and her friend used to go to try to get jobs from the sloshed executives. He tried to get her into his sex games, but when she did not get into the extremes he got tired of her. He told her when he was a teen, he and Tucker used to tie 'colored girls' up to trees and watch them struggle, but let them go instead of letting them die. When Cragen asks about Layla, she pulls out a stack of papers and gives them to Cragen.Benson and Stabler question Martin. After he drops his CEO demeanor, they tell him Sho-Ling and Amy turned him in. He tells them Tucker is the one that strangled Layla because he liked seeing how far he could go.Munch and Cassidy question Tucker. When Tucker tells them what he did to the girls in Tennessee happened when he was a minor and that was how it was then. When he adds 'It broke the boredom,' Jeffries slings the door open and asks if it broke the boredom of sitting on a porch them eating watermelon and having babies. She informs him she is a detective who just came in to look at the redneck of the New South. Before she walks out the door, she adds that Martin rolled on him. Munch explains that if he would like to give a statement the DA might consider a plea bargain. When he asks Cassidy to clarify, he tells him he and Frank are going to hang."

      "corpus": "When ADA Karen Fitzgerald is raped and murdered, the SVU squad is pressured to find the killer quickly. As the detectives discuss the case in the squad room, Benson reveals that she had been an acquaintance of hers. Jeffries adds that the ADA was raped, hit in the head with a rock, and shot twice. Munch says the case is reminiscent of the Labor Day rapist, and Cragen asks Munch, Jeffries, and Cassidy to pull the Labor Day files and search for any parallels to see if they might be looking at the same M.O. and/or the same perp.Benson and Stabler head to the crime scene in Central Park. Crime Scene Investigators tell the two detectives that the ADA was grabbed and pulled into the bushes. A book that she was reading is found on the opposite side of the knoll from which the body has been found, and the detectives surmise that she must have been sitting on the park bench below. A bird watcher on the bench admitted he was practically pushed off the bench by the perp and is brought in to try to make an ID on the perp. Out of the photos, he makes no less than ten IDs claiming all of them look like the man. Afterwards, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler that cross-references of the bird watcher's IDs match two defendants in Fitzgerald's old cases – one is Kenneth Maggio who did time for sodomy but is now out on parole. The second is Richard White who pleaded out on a date rape charge and did no time. Benson and Stabler head out to interview White.At White's office, the man said he was innocent and pleaded out on his counsel's recommendation. He added that he harbored no ill feelings toward Fitzgerald, whom he said was only doing her job. The detectives ask about his whereabouts yesterday between 3 and 5pm. White said he was previewing a house, and this could be documented because he had to put a code into a lock box at the house before he could enter. He said his alibi can also be corroborated by his partner, Kimberly Phillips, who knew his whereabouts. Benson and Stabler make a trip to Krim Properties to check White's alibi of registering his code in the properties' lock box. They corroborate his story. White 's code was entered at four o'clock. Meanwhile, Jeffries and Munch go back to a witness, Mr. Levin, who saw a man running from the scene in the Labor Day rape. The man IDs a Canadian man who was deported back to Canada. Cassidy goes to call and see if the man is registered. Munch and Cassidy follow up and find that DNA evidence in an old case is a match to the Labor Day rape case, but the man has fled somewhere in Canada and the authorities there are looking for him. The pair then head off to a doughnut shop where Maggio is working to follow up on the Maggio/Fitzgerald link. Maggio tells the two they can't pin this latest rape on him. Maggio drops his pants to reveal that in prison he was given a 'welcome' with a combination or soap and sulfuric acid leaving him permanently impotent. At the station debriefing, Munch says the Canadian man matching the Labor Day rapist's DNA is currently being searched for by Canadian officials. Benson and Stabler add that White's alibi holds up, but a review of the court documents revealed that Fitzgerald really dragged him through the mud before letting him plead down. Cragen asks Munch to follow up with White's date rape victim, Louise Billings. Jeffries has scheduled an afternoon meeting with Fitzgerald's best friend, Joan Simon. The detectives head out for their respective assignments.At Billings' apartment, Munch and Cassidy interview Louise. She revealed he was a sweet man that had a dark streak. After they broke it off, she kept running in to him repeatedly which Munch thought was a bit odd. Billings added that he was so sweet upon these meetings that she finally invited him up to dinner. At that dinner, he got drunk, violent, and raped her. On top of that, she said, he had the nerve to send her flowers the very next day. Karen Fitzgerald gave her the courage to press charges against him.As Benson and Stabler meet with Joan Simon, Fitzgerald's friend from her law school days, she said the ADA had been fearless, but about a month ago they had been out to dinner and a man was smiling at Karen. Uncharacteristically, Karen got rattled when Joan pointed him out, but wouldn't say why. Benson produces a photo lineup page and Joan IDs White in the photo lineup. In Cragen's office, Benson says that White must have been stalking his victims. As they walk out, Munch tells Cragen and the other detectives that he has been reviewing the court transcripts. White's partner, Kimberly Phillips, is his alibi in the Fitzgerald case, and she also served as a character witness in his rape trial. Benson and Stabler head out to meet with Phillips. She shows them how the lock box/code system works. Upon questioning, she adds that she met White at an open house and he suggested they go into business together, even offering to put up the seed money. Finding him a bit odd, she initially said no, and he sent her flowers the following day with a note that said 'No hard feelings'. Still, she kept running into him at various open houses and he persisted with the idea. Finally, she agreed and they've been partnered for two years. After she leaves, both of the detectives express the feeling that she's holding out on them. Benson believes that White must have something on Phillips and adds that she believes that he craves control and takes revenge on those who try to take that control away from him. In his attempts to regain control, Benson believes White raped Billings and then he killed Fitzgerald. As they discuss this with Cragen, he tells the two to bring White in for questioning.In the interrogation room, White attempts to flirt with Benson. She asks him if this is some of his famous charm and tells him that his alibi is shredding. She says that anyone can get into the lock box with another ID as long as they know that person's code. She leads him to believe that his partner has said he wasn't there that day. He counters with personal information about Benson including her college and work in the SVU squad. He says if they don't have any further evidence, he's got a house to show. White is allowed to leave. Back in the squad room, Munch tells the group that the Canadian guy is clear. He turned up dead in a smack house in Canada. Secondly, he says that he talked to a friend of his on the realty board and found out that White not only sells houses, but also makes loans – mostly to low income buyers who don't read the fine print, and 70% of those loans wind up in foreclosure. High interest and high penalties help to make White's loan business more profitable than his real estate business. White's partner, Phillips, is not a partner in the loan division and so pulls down almost nothing. Benson and Stabler go to the bank to request the bank records for Richard White and Kimberly Phillips. After a little friendly persuasion, they have the records. Those records reveal that Phillips deposits a paycheck from White/Phillips Realty each week as well as $3000 cash each week. White Loan Company withdraws $3000 each week and puts it under miscellaneous expenses. Phillips is getting three grand a week under the table. As the two detectives are talking, Stabler gets a call on his cell phone. There is no beeper assigned to Kimberly Phillips. She has to be carrying around White's. The two go to meet with Phillips again.Benson and Stabler tell her that they don't care about the IRS as long as she tells them the truth. Phillips reveals that the initial approach by White of giving loans to low income clients just didn't sit well with her and that was why she refused him. Right after, he got a frightening look in his eyes whereas Phillips thought he might hit her right in front of the other brokers, but he managed to pull himself together. However, when she received the flowers from White the next day, she was truly frightened because he had no way of knowing her home address. The day she agreed to be his partner, she had seen him following her to the open house. Benson asks why she didn't call the cops. Phillips reveals that she did, but they blew her off because she would have to say she was afraid for her life or that he was threatening her, and here he was offering her a job. Stabler adds that $150,000 a year, tax-free, must have taken the edge off her fear. She admits that she used his code to open his lock box that day as an alibi for him in the Fitzgerald case. Benson asks why she did that knowing his history from the court case. Phillips said he threatened to kill her if she told, and she really believed he would.The detectives get a warrant for Richard White's apartment. The search reveals such items as a map of Central Park with times and locations marked which incriminate him and his stalking behavior against Fitzgerald. A photo of Louise Billings is in the freezer, and a pad is taken to reveal the impressions left from previous notes. The empty hangers in the closet and the lack of food lead the detectives to believe that White has skipped town. Back at the station house, Munch warns Benson that she may be in White's sights since she squared off against him in the interrogation room. He tells her that the whole squad has her back. He leaves as Stabler enters. Stabler tells Benson that they were able to pull some of the impressions off the pad – a grocery store, gym, laundromat, pharmacist…he says they called them all to see if White frequented any of them. He didn't. It turns out the all of the locations were the locations where Benson did business. White had been stalking her.The next morning, Stabler drops by Benson's apartment to ask if she needs a lift to work. Benson says she knows what Stabler is up to, and for all she knows, White has left town. Next, the detectives are called to Billings' apartment. Louise, who had filed the rape charges against White, had been murdered in her apartment. A neighbor had heard the commotion and caught a glimpse of the guy through his peep hole. He immediately identified White in the photo lineup. Cragen gives all the detectives assignments, but tells Benson he doesn't want her on the street today. Benson insists and Cragen relents. Just then, a huge floral delivery arrives for Benson. The card reads: 'No hard feelings'. The detectives head to the floral shop and find that the arrangement was charged to the card of a Lila White. They get the address and go to Mrs. White's apartment. The woman is Richard White's wealthy mother. She says he had come home around 9am looking harried and disheveled and wanting to borrow money. She said he's a taker just like his father was, and she's prodded him to take control. Mrs. White says that Richard said he was going back to Manhatten to see a lady friend – some police woman. Stabler drops Benson off at her apartment for the evening.Benson is awakened by the phone. Richard White is on the other end asking for a meeting. He tells her to be at the park bench at 7am and to arrive alone. She tells him not to be late. The next morning, Benson arrives at the designated location as planned. As a woman and man are jogging toward the bench, the woman screams as the man pushes her out of the way revealing the knife he had poised on her. He immediately puts the knife to Benson's throat just as the entire SVU squad jumps out from behind bushes, ambushes the guy, and Benson cuffs him.Back at the station, Benson tells Stabler and Cragen that White wants to confess, but he also wants to play her reactions while he's doing it. Stabler reminds her that he has to confess to using the gun. Benson goes in to interrogate White. He asks about Benson's mother, Serena, and wants to know if she still carries the scars from her rape. He tells how he attacked Fitzgerald, but never cops to murdering his victims with a gun. He laughs and says he'll never get the death penalty, and he'll always be in Benson's head until he is dead. White then looks up at the interrogation window which Stabler is standing behind. White smirks and says, 'Detective Stabler, how are Kathy and the kids?'"

      "corpus": "When Benson and Stabler arrive at the crime scene, they are informed the body of Ryan Davies was found by two boys. They are told he was last seen Friday night between 6 and 8. They will not have a positive ID until they notify his family. The boys tell Benson they were playing touch football when the ball went into the bushes where the body was found. While Benson tries to get the whole story, Stabler gets information from the scene. Stabler is informed the 8-year-old was assaulted, strangled, and left in a shallow grave. When Benson and Stabler go to inform his parents, his mother starts yelling for her husband.When Cragen asks what they have learned, they begin telling him general lessons learned until he stops them clarifying the case. Benson begins giving them a run down on the victim when Stabler adds Ryan was found naked from the waist down with signs of sexual assault. Benson tells them he had ligature marks around his neck and bruises covering his body. Stabler tells them there was no sign of a struggle and no evidence found. Cassidy clarifies the boy was found in a shallow grave. Benson tells them they suspect the crime took place somewhere in the marshes behind the field. Cragen tells them the will keep uniforms searching the marshes. Stabler tells them the parents reported the boy missing 40 hours before he was found. Benson informs them Ryan died Friday night around 5. The bruises were caused by a hand. Jefferies tells them she will check out the adults in the boy's life and check for registered sex offenders in the area. Munch and Cassidy deduce from the MO that the perp is a stranger. Benson and Stabler inform them the boy was heading for a comic book store in search of Pokemon cards when he was attacked. Cragen sends them out to canvas the neighborhood.When Munch and Cassidy ask a few girl scouts if they know who might hurt Ryan, they are told Mike D and Jimmy G. When they locate the teens, they are told Turbit had been riding his bike around school every day for about a month. The teens tell them he lives in an apartment on Linwood.When Benson and Stabler question Bill Turbit, he claims he likes the park for the history it holds. He tells them he takes that route to clear his mind after working at the recycling center. He rides his bike for the environment. He informs them the chain has been stolen and it has been moved on him. Stabler informs him of the investigation. Turbit tells them instead of coming straight home on Friday night, he went to the tavern. When Stabler attempts to set his glass down on his stamp collection case, Turbit freaks out. As they leave, Stabler informs Benson that his father used to collect stamps. He explains the appeal as it being a lesson in the history of transportation and communication. He tells her his father sold his collection when Maureen was born to buy a bassinet and help with the rent. When they locate Turbit's bike, they collect a sample of the dirt on the tire.Munch explains to Cragen that since his parents told him to never eat sweets when he was growing up that he overdoes it as an adult. From this statement, Cassidy deduces his parents must have felt the same way about marriage. Cragen informs Benson and Stabler that forensics is working on matching the dirt and Jeffries is working on Turbit's background. Stabler tells them of the incident with the stamp collection. When Benson tells Cragen they need to search Turbit's home, he tells her they need a positive ID first so he arranges a line-up containing Turbit for the teens to view. They both ID Turbit.While they talk to Turbit, Benson and Stabler learn he plays Penny Ante Poker at the tavern with some unknown guys. He decided to go there on that night because he had acquired a special stamp and he wanted to celebrate. When they start asking about Ryan, Jeffries interrupts them. She informs them there are 9 sex offenders in the area, but only one MO matches the case. She informs them he was convicted of molesting a boy two months older than Ryan.When Benson and Stabler arrive to search Turbit's home, they are mobbed by parents from the neighborhood who are upset that he is living there and they did not know about his history. When they return to the station, the team questions the precinct's failure to notify the community of Turbit's history and the prison psychiatrist's agreement for Turbit to be released. Cragen reminds them people act differently when they have to run their own life. Stabler reminds them this victim is dead. The psychiatrist explains the details of Turbit's conviction claiming he was psychotic at the time. Stabler listens to Turbit's lawyer complain about the rights of public safety violating her client's rights while they walk to observe the collection of a DNA sample from Turbit. When they arrive, Turbit is telling them not to. When he fights, Stabler subdues him for the collection.Ryan's mother asks Benson and Stabler if they have found his glasses yet. When she tells them they are still looking, his father tells them to keep in touch.When Stabler joins his family at the park for a picnic, Dickie is not with them. He looks around and still cannot find him. He takes off running over the hill to locate his son. When he finds him, he scoops him into his arms and hugs him for dear life.When Stabler questions the guy at the tavern, it is confirmed that Turbit was there Friday night, but he left for a few hours and then returned. He also denied Turbit was playing cards that night.While Munch and Cassidy collect Turbit's bike and chain, Cassidy tells him that after seeing cases involving children his thoughts of having kids of their own disappear.At the lab, Benson and Stabler are told the dirt from the bike and the dirt from the crime scene match, but the same dirt is all over the area. The tech also shows them the life-pictures of the ligature marks on his neck. When they see the pattern, Benson holds up the chain for comparison. The design matches, but now they need to test the chain for DNA. Benson and Stabler meet with the ADA in Cragen's office. They inform her of the new found evidence, the lack of an alibi, and his prior bad act. She tells them to talk to his first victim and compare the MO's. If they match, she lock him up.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the home of Christopher James, his mother calls for him. When Stabler takes a step towards him and he flinches, Stabler joins the mother in the other room. Once they are gone, Benson tells Christopher about Ryan and tells him she needs to record his story. After he tells her his story, she turns off the recorder and thanks him. When she tells him her first name as he requests, he tells her the meaning and its origin.When Stabler and Benson arrest Turbit at his home, the guy from the bar comes forward to tell them he lied when he said Turbit was not at his bar all night. He warns them that even if he did not hurt Ryan, he will hurt someone else.When Cragen tells them they cannot hold him any more, Stabler informs him the judge denied his bail. When asked about the bartender, Stabler tells him the guy is a retired transit cop and felt guilty for having lied to a fellow cop. While Cragen is on the phone, Benson and Stabler remind the ADA they have two eyewitnesses that place Turbit at the scene and the chain matches the pattern on his neck. The ADA reminds them the eyewitnesses are teenagers and the DNA is not back on the chain. Cragen tells them not to do anything because he was just called into a meeting with the District Attorney.State Attorney General Morris Klein tells Cragen they need him to hold Turbit. Cragen tells him that he cannot without more evidence. Klein tells him about an effort to have child molesters civilly committed once they are released from prison. Cragen figures this is meant to be a test case and reminds Klein the rule is supposed to be \"You do the crime, you do the time.\" After a little pleading, Cragen gives Klein 24 hours to complete whatever he needs to. When Stabler picks Dickie up at school, Dickie informs him he has learned that his father puts child molesters in jail from a ate. Dickie tells him he can explain he is a cop to his when he comes to talk to them.While Dr. Greenblatt evaluates Turbit, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler his point of view on the psychiatric review. He believes the state searched the pool of psychiatrist until they found one that agreed with their agenda. He also believes it is situational ethics. Turbit tells Dr. Greenblatt that when he saw the crime scene photos of Christopher he could not believe he did it. He also tells her he does not remember doing it. He then informs her he is not sure what scares him more - what was done to the boy or that he did it. Cragen calls for the DNA results and finds it was not a match so he orders Turbit released, but tells Stabler he will have uniforms watching him. Dr. Greenblatt asks Cragen for Benson and Stabler's presence at the hearing for an hour or two. Cragen suggest using chemical castration or Depoprovera, but she informs him if one shot is missed then the drug loses its effectiveness. Benson suggests therapy, but Greenblatt says she cannot set his rehabilitation to a certain number of sessions. She believes civil commitment is a preemptive strike to save the community.As Turbit exits the squad room, every cop watches him all the way. When Benson and Stabler update the parents, they tell them they do not believe Turbit hurt their son, but a hearing is being held to see about getting him off the street.Stabler tells Dickie's to actually read the ID's of cops. He tells them child molesters like to play act. Child molesters also know kids like to please grown ups so they may ask for help. He tells them to never get in a car with someone you do not know. He tells them if someone is hurting them yell \"No!\" then go tell a grown up they trust. If they have no grown ups to tell, then tell a friend. If their parents are the ones hurting them, Stabler says to tell Dickie and Dickie will tell him.At the civil commitment hearing, Turbit's lawyer uses her time to question to make the point that the legislation is just a way to get around double jeopardy. When the judge breaks for the day, Stabler tells Benson he agrees with Greenblatt and he believes the only reason she does not is the fact she does not have kids. While Turbit and his lawyer walk down the steps of the courthouse, Ryan's father shoots and kills Turbit.When Cragen calls the shooting a version of an eye for an eye, Munch adds the wrong eye was shot. The team decides they are back at square one and need to speak with the eyewitnesses. Cassidy tries to get Jimmy G to relax by offering him a cola and taking a deep breath. Cassidy asks which side Turbit rode his bike. He tells him the wood side. Munch asks Mike D the same question, but he says by the river. They decide to print both of them and take blood. Cassidy says they need to search by the river.Cassidy describes the clinical phase to Stabler. When Cassidy asks what the next phase is, Stabler tells him he does not want to know. After a false alarm with the metal detector, Cassidy finds Ryan's glasses. At the lab, Benson shows Stabler the partial fingerprint lifted from Ryan's glasses. He gives the tech Jimmy G's fingerprint. After comparing them, the tech decides it is a match. When the chain is found in the marsh, Munch and Cassidy have it sent to the lab for analysis. The tech tells Benson and Stabler the DNA on the chain matches Ryan's. He also informs them DNA retrieved from under Ryan's nails matches one of the suspects. When Benson and Stabler ask Jimmy G what happened, he says he does not know. Benson tells him Mike D will tell them. When they question Mike D, they tell him they do not believe it was his idea. They believe he went along with Jimmy G. The boys tell them everything was fine until Ryan lost his glasses and started freaking out. He was killed while they were trying to keep him from screaming."

      "corpus": "While Adam is making passes at his girlfriend, he finds a girl's body in the bushes next to them. As Stabler gets ready to leave his home for the crime scene, Maureen arrives home offering no explanation. After he checks her breath for alcohol, he grounds her indefinitely. She stomps up the stair to her room complaining about the unfairness of the punishment.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, a uniform officer tells them the girl was found dead at 1:50AM by a couple of students. He further informs them his Lieutenant said the case belongs to them since she was not wearing underwear. After Benson draws attention to the wound on her head, Stabler points out the cement fragments around the wound. Benson tells the officer to start searching and to call campus security to halt trash pick up so he can search that as well. After they notice the victim is wet, the officer informs them it may be due to the automatic sprinkler system. While Stabler talks to the couple that found her, Benson locates her identification. She calls him over to inform him the victim is Jeanne Gallagher who is a sophomore residing in Bowman Hall, which is not far from where she was found.Benson tells the team she believes there were two attackers, but Jeffries disagrees. Stabler informs them the information they currently have is preliminary. Benson interjects to tell them the only conclusive evidence they have is the fact her alcohol level was .27 and the alcohol was consumed at a party for the St. Raymond's basketball team. Munch and Cassidy get sidetracked discussing how college athletes get paid with items instead of money. Bringing them back to reality, Cragen sends them to speak with the administration of the university while Jeffries bails to go to court.Father McCourt informs Munch and Cassidy the university will be holding a mass in honor of Jeanne's life. When Munch tells them they need to speak with people who actually knew Jeanne, he tells them the university will investigate the incident and send them a full report. Cassidy explains they know Jeanne was drunk. Father McCourt tells them they need to speak with the Hostess Committee explaining they help support the basketball team.The Hostess Committee provides tutoring, logistical support, and laundry services. They are also told the parties are to help the players relax, but prospective players, coaches, hostesses, and important alumni also attend. They learn that Jeanne arrived early to the party to help set up, but her roommate, Shelley Brown, may know what time she left. Riley Couger arrives making himself comfortable on the sofa. Munch informs him he knows about his drinking reputation. Couger tells them he left the party early to go to a party with the Mayor, but before he left he saw Chuck Mosley arguing with a crying Jeanne. He lets them know they can locate Mosley playing basketball off Fifth Avenue.Munch and Cassidy locate Mosley exactly where Couger said he would be. Cassidy informs him they are there to talk about Jeanne's murder. After Mosley accuses them of being racially biased, Munch threatens for him to come willingly now or in cuffs in the back of a wagon later. As they put Mosley in their car, he tells them he and Jeanne went to the party together after basketball practice. He explains the argument was about him wanting her to leave when she had had too much to drink. He further tells them he went home and watched late night television with his mother, who is currently on a bus trip to Louisiana to visit his sick aunt.On their way into the squad room, Munch updates Benson on the two suspects alibis. Stabler suspects the university is trying to stonewall the investigation because they would lose a lot of money if they put one or two of their star players in jail. Munch explains the business/merchandising side of college athletics. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to speak with the administration and Shelley Brown.While Benson and Stabler search Jeanne's room, Brown explains that in order to get tickets, cars, and trips, the hostesses are expected to provide hospitality to the players. She informs them that while she quit as a hostess, Jeanne needed the money and the scholarship from it. Brown also tells them Jeanne began drinking heavily after the game that got the team into the Sweet16 and she moved in with her parents for a few weeks.When Mr. Gallagher claims Jeanne was under a lot of stress, Mrs. Gallagher informs Benson and Stabler that Jeanne had been raped.Benson and Stabler return to the university and explain to Dr. Goodall the best thing she can do for Jeanne is to tell them what she confided in her. Dr. Goodall explains Jeanne only told her that her rapist was on the basketball team. She also told them with Jeanne facing an abortion, nightmares, and heaving drinking she did not have time to push her for the identity of her rapist.When Munch inquires about Mosley's choice of studies, Mosley tells him in an intellectual way that the police are doing a great job.When talking with Professor Rousseau, Benson and Stabler learn while Mosley expects to earn his GPA, Couger expects his handed to him. When Benson and Stabler interrupt Couger's practice shots in the gym, he informs them he was sitting in the campus security office sleeping a drunken stupor when Jeanne was raped. They take this information back to Cragen telling him they believe it is a cover up. Cragen tells them of a car accident he was in while attending St. Raymond's where campus security decided to let the other driver off saying it was a youthful indiscretion. He tells them he would love to take a shot at campus security.Cragen confronts campus security about the entry about Couger being there the night Jeanne was raped. The security officer informs him he was covering for Couger because Couger said he just broke up with her and he thought she might try to lie and say he raped her. Cragen tells him that since he helped Couger, now they are looking into her rape and murder.While the rest of the Stabler family prepares dinner, Maureen comes downstairs surprised to see Stabler there. She tells him she has been in her room for days. He tells her that unless she is ready to talk to go back to her room. Kathy tells him she does not think he is handling it right asking what would have happened if her parents reacted that way with her. He tells her they would not have had Maureen. Benson and Stabler interrupt Rodgers to inform her they have two suspects, but they need the DNA to compare them to. Rodgers informs them the doer has a low sperm count and as soon as they get her the samples she can have the results within an hour.At the station, Cragen informs Father McCourt and Reverend Clayton that even though it is a venial sin in the eyes of the church, they need the samples to solve this crime. When they enter the squad room and give their approval, Cassidy gives Couger and Mosley the containers with complete instructions. Once in the hall, Mosley informs Munch that he and Jeanne had protected sex before the party.   In court, Jeffries informs the judge that the defendant was killed in custody in the same manner in which he killed his victim. When the judge dismisses the case, Jeffries discusses with the ADA what they need to get a conviction with a dead victim and no physical evidence. He tells her they need a reliable witness to get a hearsay exception. When he finds out it is a decorated ex-cop, he tells her to reserve the defendant a place at Rikers.As Benson and Stabler arrive on campus, Stabler informs her he wanted to go to a four year school and live in the dorms, but he had a new wife and baby limiting his options as far as school was concerned. He tells her he wanted to go to Everglades University because Playboy ranked colleges according to their sexual temperature and EU was always at the top of the list.They return to ask Rousseau if Mosley was in class the day after Jeanne was killed. He confirms that he was, but he was distracted. Rousseau thought it was a hangover. After leaving his office, Benson and Stabler express their confusion as to the two versions of Mosley that Rousseau gave them. This confusion causes them to question what Rousseau is up to.Jefferies informs the team both suspects have normal sperm counts. Cragen tells them they can let Couger go, but Mosley is stuck until his alibi checks out. Munch tells them Mosley's mother is on her way.Mrs. Mosley confirms her son was home by 1AM. She also tells Munch and Cassidy she makes him stick to a curfew and his academics always come before basketball. She believes her son will be somebody other than a dumb jock. Outside the interrogation room, Munch informs Cragen that no matter what they do to Mosley, his mother can punish him worse. Cragen then orders Mosley's release.Benson and Stabler return to discuss Rousseau with Brown. She informs them his class was originally supposed to be a seminar. She tells them Rousseau began looking at Jeanne, but Jeanne was not into it. She explains Rousseau was everywhere Jeanne went...the bookstore, the library. She tells them the only way a tenured professor will lose their job is to kill someone.Benson and Stabler discuss the problems Jeanne had with Rousseau with Father McCourt. He says it was his word against hers and he told Rousseau to adjust his behavior accordingly. Benson tell him he should have been in jail. Stabler explains it is called stalking or it could lead up to Menacing in the first degree. Benson reminds him the District Attorney makes the decisions on the charges filed, not him.After Cragen reads through Rousseau's record, ADA Carmichael tells him it sounds like a time line of sex crime legislation. Carmichael tells him she needs physical evidence before they can arrest him. When Cragen tells her they will re-canvas, she tells him to search his office and home as well.When Stabler drops Maureen off at school, he jumps out of the car ready to settle things with her. She tells him she did not do anything. He says he believes her, but he reminds her he sees the bad part of the city every day and he does not want one of the calls he gets to be to pick up her body parts. They both apologize as the bell rings.While looking at the makeshift memorial the students set up for Jeanne, Stabler tells Benson if she lets the place he dies turn into that, he will haunt her for the rest of her life. They begin looking over the crime scene again. Stabler decides since they did not find the murder weapon on the ground, maybe it was a building. As they look at the building walls, they notice the stairs. Benson alleges she was pushed down the stairs and hit her head.While speaking with Rousseau's assistant, they find she does all of the grading, but he keeps his own schedule. When Stabler spots the schedule on the desk and looks over it, they realize it was Jeanne's schedule. His assistant tells them he is in class in the Quad. When they arrive in the Quad, Stabler dismisses his class while Benson places him under arrest.In the interrogation room surrounded by attorneys and cops, Rousseau tells them he did not rape or kill Jeanne. Stabler and Benson present their take on what happened, but Rousseau tells them she was already dead when he carried her into the bushes to make love to her. When everyone else leaves the room, Father McCourt tells him he is responsible for his own legal fees. Rousseau tells him he makes his confession to God. Rousseau's attorney gets Carmichael to plea the charges down to sex with a deceased person. Carmichael walks back into the room and tells Rousseau they also have him on obstruction and disturbing a crime scene.  She also tells him she will make sure he serves them consecutively.Munch and Cassidy arrive at the Mosleys' to find them packing for their move. Mosley complains about the problems the case has caused him. Munch tells him he is a fan of his. He also tells him he handled himself like a man through the entire thing. He apologizes on behalf of the police force. Mosley complains about losing a year of eligibility. Before they leave, Munch tells him Couger will be indicted for rape."

      "corpus": "When Stabler arrives at the crime scene, he is met by a uniform officer ready to escort him to the body. She informs him the victim is 42-year-old Richard F. Schiller. Once inside he recognizes the look on her face as that of a first timer. When Annabelle Hayes notices them in the room, she hatefully asks his identity. Benson tells her he is her partner and after making sure Hayes is okay makes her way to Stabler to fill him in. Benson explains Annabelle, who found the body, and her daughter, Virginia, rent the room to the victim. Annabelle makes sure she tells him Schiller was never late on his rent After getting hateful with Stabler when he tries to get the uniform officer to take her for coffee, Annabelle willingly takes Benson up on her offer to get coffee. As soon as they are out of the room, the uniform officer tells Stabler the victim wrote travel books for a living.After the team spends a little time debating Schiller's talent, Cragen asks for details. Benson and Stabler fill them in on what they know. Schiller did not have a record. His ex-wife of 10 years runs a local tea importing business. He had lived with the Hayes's for two years without missing a payment. He was killed in the early evening as the result of blunt force trauma being left out in plain view. They continue by telling them there was no sign of forced entry and the murder weapon has yet to be found. The tape over his mouth was the only piece of its type in the entire house and contained no fingerprints. Benson believe is was personal because of the panties in his mouth and his mouth being taped shut. Munch believes it was to embarrass him. Cassidy thinks it may have been to silence him. Cragen wants to know how Annabelle knew Schiller. While Stabler and Benson go to take care of that, Cragen sends Munch and Cassidy to see Schiller's ex-wife.Benson and Stabler meet up with Annabelle at work. As she continues to work answering phones, she answers their questions between calls. She informs them Virginia never came home. Stabler asks for a picture they can circulate to look for her. After giving him the picture, Annabelle tells them of how she came to find the body. She came home from work and upon sorting the mail she found a bill for him. She took his mail to him, but after there was no response to her knocking she went in and found him. She explains she and her husband bought the house for their future, but he left so she takes in tenants to help with the mortgage. She tells them Schiller never brought anyone home and she only had a business relationship with him adding he had a fantastic credit rating before directing them upstairs to his editor, John Freeman.Freeman explains Schiller liked to live dangerously and explore the blank spaces on the map. He tells them Schiller did not like the baggage of relationships, but when he did the relationship always ended on a good note.Schiller's ex-wife informs Munch and Cassidy it has been a few months since the last time she saw Schiller. She explains he promised her no more traveling when they were married, but he was not happy. She muses that now she deals with ten countries a day. Before they leave, she tells them she always knew she was not the great love of his life. As they leave, Munch and Cassidy discuss the irony of a remarkable life ending in degradation.While Cassidy speaks with Germany, Munch with Russia, and Benson with Belize, Stabler gets amused watching their frustration as they all come up empty handed. When Benson suggests it may have been a one night stand ending in a nightmare, Jefferies interrupts saying Virginia was caught shoplifting at a newsstand in Grand Central Station. Benson and Stabler head out to get her.When they arrive, the uniform officer on the scene releases Virginia to Benson and Stabler. The owner of the stand refuses to let them go until he gets paid for the magazine so Stabler pays him. After they introduce themselves, they are briefly interrupted by a man needing directions. Once he leaves, Stabler tells her something happened at home the night before.When they arrive at the Hayes residence, Annabelle comes out and tells her daughter Schiller is dead. Virginia yells at her telling her she could not keep her hands off of him. Benson holds Virginia back while Stabler holds Annabelle back.Benson and Stabler take Virginia back to the station to talk to her. Virginia claims her mother is an alcoholic that drove her father out of her life. The night prior, she went swimming, but go on the wrong train on the way home so she just rode around for a while. She confirms Schiller never brought anyone home. Her mother made advances toward Schiller, but he never took her up on it. She tells them the underwear belongs to her mother. When they return to the squad room, Stabler introduces Virginia to Munch and Cassidy so they can take her home. Munch tells her she can drive when she asks. Benson and Stabler decide to go talk to the one former tenant that remains in Manhattan.They locate the former tenant in a record store. He tells them Annabelle repeatedly made passes at him. When he brought home a friend to pretend she is his girlfriend to stop Annabelle's advances, she threw her out and read him the lease saying no overnight guests without permission. The only reason he stayed was because he was broke and in grad school.Benson and Stabler meet with Annabelle in her kitchen. She tells them the only thing she knows about Schiller's death is what she saw. His mouth was taped shut and he had an erection. Annabelle gets aggravated when Benson tries to clarify that no one else was in the house. After Stabler asks if she touched the body when she found it, Benson explains a pair of lacy underwear was found in the victim's mouth causing Stabler to clarify the underwear was Annabelle's. When confront her about her anger towards Schiller's rejection, she denies it was recent claiming she has a boyfriend, Thomas Dayton, that works in a department store. She informs them she met Tom for drinks at Julian's Bistro and they had a fight the night prior. At Julian's Bistro, Benson and Stabler are told the argument started over the tip, but ended up over who loved who more. She informs them Tom left first leaving Annabelle nursing a couple of Manhattans. The waitress told Annabelle women are better off with mechanical devices.Benson and Stabler meet Tom in the parking lot at his car. He knows they are there about Schiller. He explains he has been seeing Annabelle for six or seven months and even though she is serious he is not sure he is ready to be a father to a teenager. He confirms the fight with Annabelle was about Schiller saying they all started there, but decided he overreacted. He tells them he went home to bed after and the doorman can confirm it.Benson offers Stabler a possible scenario of events, but Stabler wonders if Dayton is strong enough to take Schiller on. When he questions why they were not told about Schiller earlier, Benson guesses she was protecting the man she loves.While the Stabler family gets ready to go out to dinner, Stabler receives a call forcing him back to work. He tells them he will meet them for dessert, but Maureen doubts he will show. Kathy has them all tell their father bye. When Maureen tells Stabler not to kiss her on the lips, Stabler is puzzled causing Kathy to explain their daughter is growing up while he is at work.When Benson and Stabler run Thomas Dayton through their computer, they find he died in a car crash in'87. They check to see if he has any siblings. They find he had an older brother Scott who apparently decided to borrow his brother's social security number after being convicted of two counts of child molestation in '90 in Seattle. Benson and Stabler realize it was not Annabelle he wanted to himself, it was Virginia.As Benson and Stabler see Scott Dayton helping a young girl try on a dress, they ask if he knows where they might find Scott Dayton. He knocks Stabler over with a clothing rack and takes off running through the store knocking things in their way to prevent his capture before finally getting caught. He claims he was just doing his job. Benson tells him that is exactly what they were afraid of. In the interrogation room, Dayton explains his job requires him to help awkward teenagers look their best even on tight budgets. He tells them alterations are often needed because there is no such thing as a perfect size. He informs them he is trained as a dressmaker and it involves touching. When Benson asks if Annabelle knew about his record, he tells her he wanted a clean start that he could not get once he was released. After he tells them he and Annabelle had a normal sex life of three times a week, Stabler guesses he was thinking of Virginia every time. Dayton informs them he is in therapy and has learned to control his impulses. He explains he never had the chance anyway because they were both all over Schiller and Virginia always won. He noticed the looks Schiller gave Virginia. Stabler asks him if the person he changed into was still jealous of the affections of a little girl. He tells Dayton he is surprised he did not ask Annabelle to marry him so Virginia would be daddy's little girl causing Benson to pull him out of the room.Benson tells Stabler that sometimes enough is enough. He does not think so though. When Cassidy offers the guy has a regular job, Munch reminds him it is in the Juniors Department. Benson reminds them they do not have any hard evidence on Dayton. Stabler reminds her of his identity theft and his parole violation and suspects he is blaming Schiller for his own feelings. Cragen tries to understand the situation. They have a convicted pedophile who denies molesting anyone and a dead guy who was not a pedophile who might have. When Benson suggests Dayton may be telling the truth, Cragen asks if she thinks pedophiles always tell the truth. He tells them to ask Virginia.Benson and Stabler meet up with Virginia at the pool. Virginia claims Dayton would wake her up every night he did not get what he wanted from her mother after Annabelle went to sleep or passed out.  She says he forced her to touch him, perform oral sex on him, and intercourse. When she asked him to stop Schiller heard him and came to her room to threaten him. She admits to finding Schiller's body and ran because she freaked out. She spent the night at the train station reading the arrivals and departures board. She tells them she never left because she did not have anyone to go to. She explains she would wear her mother's underwear. After her shower, she hid them in the hamper. She claims she found his body around six, but could not tell them the position of the body. Instead she takes forty showers and swims and she still does not feel clean.In the squad room, Stabler tells the team it was only a matter of time before Dayton struck again. Cragen is sorry it was Virginia. The ADA believes they have enough to hold him on. Cragen informs them uniform officers went over the house twice and never found a weapon. Stabler tells them Dayton had plenty of time to get rid of it. When Benson questions why Virginia did not tell them about the underwear, Stabler reminds her she did not want to get into trouble. When Stabler tries to blow off the fact Virginia did not know what position the body was in, Benson reminds him you do not forget something like that and she started up the tear factory as soon as Benson asked. When the ADA asks what is going on, Benson tells them Virginia was putting on a performance. When Benson tries to suggest Virginia fled the scene and Cragen blows it off as fear, Benson tells him OJ was taking an afternoon drive. When Jefferies informs them the ME found secretions on Schiller and found the match on the underwear, Benson and Stabler finally agree it was Virginia and Schiller, not Dayton. Cragen suggests it was either Annabelle walked in on them and killed him or Dayton walked in on them and killed him. Benson adds another option – Virginia flew into a rage and killed him. Stabler still does not by that one.When Benson and Stabler try to talk with Virginia, Annabelle denies them access. Benson tells her to have her at the station with a lawyer at eight in the morning. When she sees Virginia, Benson asks her if killing a man makes her feel grown up.At the Stabler residence, Stabler and Kathy make out on the sofa. Stabler gets sidetracked talking about Maureen having a boyfriend that she kisses on the lips named Jim Delmonico. He is six feet tall, a junior, and first string fullback. Kathy informs him Jim asked Maureen to the Homecoming dance. Kathy tells him he will probably run into him since they study together a lot. When he does not like the sound of that, Kathy tells him to relax. He asks if Maureen has had sex yet. All she can say is she hopes not. While Stabler wonders how they will know, Kathy wonders if they will know.When Jefferies reminds Munch she is a child, Munch and Stabler tell her the Appeals Court judge is not blind. After Cassidy tells them women mature faster than men, Munch claims it is a conspiracy. Jefferies asks Munch if there is anything he just accepts. He tells her compliments explaining why he is so skeptical. Stabler answers a call telling them Virginia is in the hospital after trying to commit suicide.The doctor informs Benson and Stabler that Virginia was admitted at seven in the morning after cutting one wrist with minimal blood loss. The doctor informs them when a teenager is serious about killing themselves they usually succeed so this one was for attention. They are interrupted when Annabelle arrives yelling at Benson telling her she caused her to lose the most important thing in her life – Dayton. When she becomes threatening to Benson, Stabler blocks her.The ADA and Cragen inform Benson and Stabler that Annabelle is threatening to sue. Stabler tells them she is an alcoholic. The ADA tells them that does not justify their actions. When she asks about the use of kid gloves, Benson tells her if she was a kid she would have used them. After the ADA reminds her she is a kid, Benson tells her she may be age wise, but she is not in any other way and probably not a victim either. Cragen tells the ADA drunks are always victims in their own minds. When they asks if there was a relationship between Schiller and Virginia, Benson and Stabler disagree on the details. When the ADA asks if Virginia killed Schiller, Benson and Stabler disagree again. When she suggests it could be self-defense, Cragen tells her they will call her. Neither can wait for the answers.Benson explains Annabelle had a revolving door of boyfriends causing Virginia to learn men are a commodity. She tells them there is some truth to the idea that every girl wants to marry her father and when he is absent a younger girl could be attracted to an older man. When she tells him it happens more than he thinks, he asks how old she was. She explains she was almost seventeen and he was about the age she is now, but she could not have loved him more. Stabler tells her it is an unequal relationship and being in love does not absolve an affair. She tells him she is not saying being in love is an excuse. She is saying soul mates come in all shapes and sizes. He questions her use of soul mates. After reminding him Virginia did not remember the position of the body, she tells him he is trying to protect his daughter and he cannot.At the Stabler residence, Kathy walks Maureen down the stairs taking pictures. Maureen greets Jim and he gives her a wrist corsage. She puts it on and hands her mother the box. Kathy wants a picture of them at the fireplace. When she is trying to take it, she notices Stabler is still standing there so she asks him to move. When Kathy tells them she wants one more, Maureen tells her they need to go. Kathy tell Stabler to say goodnight to them as she tells them to have fun. Stabler tells Maureen she looks beautiful causing her to approach him and hug him telling him goodnight. When she tells him not to wait up for her, he tells her \"Yeah right.\"Benson and Stabler arrive at the Hayes residence at Virginia's request. When they go in, Benson yells for her. Virginia yells telling them she is upstairs. When they get there, Benson confirms Dayton never touched her. When Stabler tells her if Schiller assaulted her it changes everything, she tells him she would not call it assault. Virginia tells them Schiller would tell her and Annabelle stories about his travels. It got intimate on July 17th after eating Ethiopian food. She kissed him and denies he coerced her. She tells them for the first time making love felt natural, good, and safe. Their relationship continued for months making the house bearable. Every time he left, she would cry every night and every time he came back he would promise he would never leave her again. She read his mail telling her he was leaving again for Romania. She packed her bag wanting to go with him. She satisfied him the way he liked. When they were finished, she asked him to take her with him. He told her he needed to travel light and she could not stay at home. She put her knee on his throat and held it there. When he was still, she picked up her underwear and put it in his mouth. She left. She tells them he had this drive to travel. He always promised to take her away from this life to a place where he would love her. Stabler comes to Cragen's office to talk to him. After Cragen asks him if he had a rough day, he tells Stabler they are arraigning Virginia on Manslaughter Two in the morning. Stabler tells him he has a daughter a little younger than Virginia. When she was little, he used to take her to the park and to the grocery store. He would look obsessively at the men around wanting to protect her from anything they might do to her. He continues ignoring Cragen's attempt to say something. When her date came to pick her up, he was thinking about what this guy was going to do to her. Stabler tells him he made a mistake and could not see what Benson did. He explains he saw his daughter as a victim not as someone capable of love. Cragen tells him his daughter caring for someone does not mean she loves him less. He guesses Stabler wants to be the only man in her life. He finally concedes before Cragen tells him his feelings will always be a part of his police work. He tells him the more he denies them the more they will control him. He tells him not to worry when he feels something, worry when he does not."

      "corpus": "The Stabler family sits at the dinner table listening to Maureen talk about an argument between two of her friends. She quickly changes the subject to body piercing causing her parents to tell her she cannot have anything pierced. When Kathy finally gets her to allow someone else to talk, Kathleen tells them her friend, Ashley, quit school because she is pregnant. Later that night while Stabler lays awake, his phone rings calling him to a scene.When Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene, D'Angelo informs them tourists found the body. He also tells them he believes she is a prostitute. When Benson notices he seems a little too interested, she tells him to go check on his partner. When Stabler inquires as to what happened, he is told it looks like she went there willingly and then the john strangled her and bashed her head in. He is also told they have one footprint with blood in it. D'Angelo comes back over to them and asks for a copy of the pictures and told them not to work too hard on the case because she was not important. Benson tells him he should retire.When Stabler tells the team how this victim died, Cragen informs him Homicide had a similar case the previous month. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to check with prostitutes to see if they can identify her. When Munch informs Cragen he has court, Jeffries tells him not to mess up the court case by rambling while he is on the stand.As Benson and Stabler approach a group of prostitutes, they break up and start walking away. Stabler shows the picture and asks if they have seen her. When he does not get an answer, he asks if they have had any rough tricks lately. Rose tells them of being beaten badly and then she tells them he was family. Benson tells her to call Victim's Services. When Stabler tells them about the guy holding a plastic bag over her head, one of the prostitutes tells him about a living victim Lorinda and they might find her on 9th Avenue.When they get to the location, they ask the transvestites if they have seen Lorinda. They are told she tried to come there a few times, but they ran her off. As they get back into the car, Stabler tells Benson about the Kathleen's 14-year-old pregnant friend, but before they could talk to her about it she locked herself in her room. When Stabler attempts to call Children' Services to get Rose, Benson talks him into checking with Vice to see if they have anything on Lorinda.Since they are at lunch, Stabler and Benson meet up with D'Angelo at Sam's. Stabler asks him about Carmel, the victim from the month prior. When he lets on that he had, Benson asks him why he failed to mention it at the crime scene. Stabler tells him about Lorinda. When he denies knowing her, Detective Ridley reminds him he busted her a few months ago. D'Angelo reminds them they have a sensitivity training While Benson and Jeffries climb the Rock Wall, Benson explains what happened at the crime scene with D'Angelo. They both agree they would like to bust some balls.In the morgue, Rodgers explains the victim died from asphyxiation and the blows to the head were unnecessary. She also tells them the victim was drug free and her stomach contents were not from a prostitute's diet.In court, Munch explains he was the detective who spoke with Ms. Webber about her attack. He explains she went to Dr. Ott to obtain a prescription for Prozac. When he diagnosed her with hysteria, he told her to undress, put her feet in the stirrups, and picture David Hasselhoff. When his expertise on the subject was questioned, he explained the development of treatments for hysteria beginning with an orgasm and vibrators. To get the case back on track, the ADA then asks if this form of treatment is legal. Munch simply answers that it is not.When Munch returns to the squad room, Stabler asks him how it went. Munch tells him he believes he won the case for the prosecution. Jeffries tells them they may have found a match for their victim. Tracy Henderson who has been missing for two days. When Benson and Stabler arrive at the home of John and Carol Henderson, they hope they have their information wrong. When they ask about Tracy, they find she is a sophomore at Columbia and she volunteers at a literacy center. Stabler shows them the photo and their reaction confirms it is in fact Tracy. Benson informs them she was found in Times Square where she had been attacked. Stabler informs them Tracy was dressed provocatively and the perp seems to be targeting prostitutes. Without saying a word, Carol Henderson calmly walks over to Stabler and slaps him.  After Munch and Cassidy make fun of Stabler for being slapped, Benson informs them they are moving away from the prostitution angle. Stabler explains he cannot see how she could go from a model family to selling herself on the streets. Benson tells them she was not into drugs. Munch questions the outfit she was wearing. Jeffries explains she would wear the same thing if she were to go clubbing. When Stabler says he would not let his daughters go out dressed like that, Benson tells him to just wait. When Jeffries tells Munch to respect the victims, he tells her he respects prostitutes, but not ex-wives. Cragen breaks them up sending Jeffries to make sure the attack on Lorinda was for real. Cragen then sends Benson and Stabler to talk to Tracy's boyfriend.Benson and Stabler interrupt Dennis Caulfield's conversation with a co-worker to inform him of Tracy's murder. They move their conversation into his office for privacy. When they inform him it happened two days ago, he tells them he had plans with her, but she never showed up. He never tried to call her thinking she just got tied up with work. He tells them he watched the Yankees game with Bill Griswald and he won a bet. When they asked for Griswald's number, he pulled a business card out of his pocket. He told them he was the only guy she was seeing.When they arrive at the literacy center, Stabler tells Benson they tried talking to Kathleen, but she freaked out again. He assures her he knows the damage that could be done by not talking to her. After looking around, he realizes the center is six blocks from where Carmel was found.At the center, they were told Tracy was loved by everyone. Only one student has not shown up...Travis Hall. They are told he is a parolee out of Rikers.Mrs. Overton walks Benson and Stabler up the stairs saying Travis probably did whatever it is they think he did. Benson stops her from coming any further. When they gain entrance into the apartment, they are hit with the smell of death. They go in far enough to confirm his death, but quickly exit saying he has an alibi since he has been dead for about a week.In the squad room, the rest of the squad tries to find common links to the victims. Jeffries tells them Carmel, the first dead prostitute, was asphyxiated with a garbage bag, received blunt force trauma to the head, and was left in a sexuality position. Munch says it was the same for Tracy, but they are not sure if she was actually a prostitute. Cassidy reminds them Lorinda's was only attempted. Jeffries further tells them Carmel was black and found in an alley. Munch tells them Tracy was black and found at a construction site. Cassidy lets them know Lorinda is Latina, but they do not know where she is. Surprisingly, Jeffries informs them Carmel's crime scene was contaminated with powder from latex gloves, but it does not make sense because the forensic tech is good. Benson and Stabler interrupt to inform them Travis Hall is dead. Benson tells them she thinks the key is finding Lorinda. Cassidy suggests they try locating Lorinda on Gansvoort.Surprisingly, when Benson and Stabler arrive at Gansvoort, they see Lorinda attempting to do some business. When she sees them she runs and throws her bag into the dumpster before they catch her. They explain they are not there to arrest her, but they are looking for the guy that attacked her. She willingly goes with them back to the station to talk.She tells them the guy stands in front of her, shines a flashlight in her eyes at an angle before hitting her with the flashlight. While he has the bag over her face, she tries to claw at his hands but they are smooth because of the latex gloves he is wearing. She then reaches back, grabs his cajones, jerks, and runs. When she is finished, she asks them if the reason they are working the case so hard now is because someone important was hurt.In the squad room, Benson and Stabler demonstrate Lorinda's story for the rest of the squad. When hearing of the gloves, Cragen suggests Carmel's attacker could have been wearing gloves as well. Upon seeing the position the flashlight was held in, Munch demonstrates how a civilian holds a flashlight and how cops hold theirs. It is then determined the perp is a cop.Benson and Stabler go back and speak with the prostitutes again, but this time they ask them who the cop is with the worst temper. When they return, they inform Cragen that D'Angelo is their prime candidate. Cragen reminds them D'Angelo has arrested them so it could just be a grudge. Benson tells him they have had problems with D'Angelo themselves. Stabler informs him D'Angelo has some slaps on the wrist in his jacket, but he is not dirty. Cragen agrees to talk to Lennie Briscoe to get more information on the guy.After talking a little about their drinking days in the 70s, Cragen asks Briscoe about D'Angelo. He tells him D'Angelo's partner Ridley is a guy with a bad temper. When Cragen returns to the station, he gives Benson Ridley's IAD file. They notice he has two assault complaints by prostitutes and a domestic abuse complaint by his wife. Cragen warns them his psychological report reads like the Chinese flag. He tells them to check this guy out as far back as they can go.At Kew Gardens, they find out Ridley's mother would leave crackers outside the door when she had a john so he would know to stay out. They head back to the station to check Ridley's arrest records against the assaults in his precinct. They discuss their theory on how Ridley went from hating his mother to killing prostitutes when Stabler's alarm goes off alerting him to his appointment with Kathleen. Benson tells him to stress the importance of protecting the goal.While kicking soccer balls at Kathleen in their back yard, Stabler tells her to cut off his angle. When she misses again, she gets upset with him for his advice. Stabler tells her other players know more tricks and to never commit until she knows where they are coming from because they will attack her at every angle. Kathleen understands what he is talking about and tells him she is a virgin just before she kicks the ball right past him.The next morning, Stabler goes to the crib to wake Benson. As they walk back into the squad room, she informs him she worked all night cross-referencing attacks on prostitutes with the precincts where Ridley worked over the past 29 or 30 years. When she shows him the pictures of the dead prostitutes linked together as if they are holding hands, he says they are like a string of paper dolls.Cragen, Benson, and Stabler arrive at Ridley's house with uniform officers while Ridley is waxing his car. Cragen asks him for his weapon, but when he reaches for it, Stabler quickly goes to retrieve it for himself. As he reaches down, Benson believes he is going for his back-up piece and alerts everyone. After they all draw their weapons, Ridley picks up the wax and closes it.At the station, the team watches as Ridley surveys the detectives' work on the case. After almost an hour, Cragen sends Benson and Stabler in to talk to him. Ridley tells them he almost had it out of his system. After telling them about two of his victims, he informs them he did not kill Tracy and he wants his record accurate.When they leave the interrogation room, Cragen reminds them of the difference between signatures and MO's. When they decide he is telling the truth, Cragen tells them he thinks the killer is someone who knew Tracy.John Henderson shows up at the squad room to apologize to Stabler for his wife slapping him and to thank them for catching their daughter's killer. Stabler informs him it was the wrong guy, but promises to catch the guy responsible. When Stabler reminds Benson they solved 18 out of 19 cases, Cragen encourages them to make it 19 closed cases. He asks them if they checked Caulfield's phone records and confirmed that Tracy never called him, Benson tells him they stopped in their tracks when they thought Ridley did it. Cragen tells them to pick it up where they left off. Stabler tells him Caulfield's alibi checked. They realize Caulfield was too quick with the business card and feel it is suspicious he does not know his best friend's number from memory.Benson and Stabler meet with Bill Griswald and inform him he could be charged as an accomplice if he is providing a false alibi. He tells them Caulfield's real girlfriend works for Prada. He also tells them Tracy was supposed to be Caulfield's wild adventure before marriage, but Tracy was a virgin. Caulfield stood Tracy up from what he had been told. Benson tells him to get a new friend.     As Benson and Stabler begin discussing the case again, Stabler realizes they had found a bloody footprint at the crime scene so they return to the forensics lab. The tech tells them it is a 11C Velletti Brothers shoe. Stabler is amazed when Benson corrects him saying it is a Velenti Brothers shoe and they are sold at only one place. The shoe salesman tells them they are $820 shoes and have only sold a dozen. Stabler tells him he wants the receipts. When Benson expresses concern that Caulfield has thrown away the shoes, Stabler assures her he would not throw shoes that expensive away.Munch and Benson go through the shoes taken from Caulfield's possession with a search warrant looking for the shoes. While they do not find the shoes, they do find a voter's registration card giving his parents' house as his legal residence.While Benson and Stabler inform the Caulfields of their son's girlfriend and the fact she was murdered, Dennis arrives asking what they want. They search the bag he is carrying causing his father to leave the room to call his lawyer. When they present him with their theory on what happened, he denies it to his mother. When she questions why Dennis had not mentioned this girlfriend, Benson notices he is wearing the shoes they are looking for."

      "corpus": "While EMTs and Dr. Lock tend to an elderly patient arriving in an ambulance, when they hear the horn of an SUV honking. Dr. Lock asks an EMT to check it out. As he begin approaching the vehicle, it drives off leaving a girl laying on the pavement.Stabler arrives at Roosevelt Hospital and asks Benson if they have anything on a crime scene. She tells him the girl was dumped in the street outside the hospital. A uniform officer brings them the girl's things and tells them her name is Theresa Burgess. Dr. Lock interrupts them informing them she was hit with a claw hammer leaving over 30 wounds. She also tells them the girl was raped by wooden object, which left behind splinters that were removed. The problem the doctor is more concerned about is the girl overdosed.Cragen tells the team Theresa is a 16-year-old model and asks Benson and Stabler to fill them in on the rest. Stabler tells them she was dumped from a late model dark red or black SUV at the hospital around 3:33 am. Benson tells them she had methamphetamine in her knapsack. Jeffries comes to the conclusion since the face, breast and genitals sustained the most damage and she was dropped off at the ER, that the perp must know her. Benson believes it may be one-way familiarity. Cassidy and Munch tell the group her face is everywhere. Stabler tells them her last appointment was a photo shoot. When Cragen asks about the parents, he is told messages were left for the mother who lives upstate and the father lives in Queens. Cragen and Stabler want to know why the teen was out on the streets at 3:00 am while her father was at home. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the father, Munch and Cassidy to talk with the other models at the photo shoot, and Jeffries to court involving a comic book called Rape Man.At the hospital, Benson and Stabler inform the father any minor out anywhere at 3AM runs the risk of being attacked. He informs them his daughter's name has been changed to Jazmin for professional reasons. He tells them the last time he saw his daughter was when he dropped her off at the photo shoot at six. He says he was worried, but did not check on her because he did not want to be a troublemaker. He was told their was nothing to worry about by her agent, Nina Laszlo.At the modeling agency, Laszlo tells Benson and Stabler she left the photo shoot when she felt everything was okay. When asked about Jazmin's use of amphetamines, Laszlo denied knowing anything about it. She states that after she left Carlo Parisi, the photographer, was in charge of the girls and their safety. When Benson asks her what kind of car she drives, she tells her a white Acura.Benson and Stabler interrupt Parisi's photo shoot asking about Jazmin's whereabouts the night of her murder. He tells them she arrived at six, but he is not sure because he was setting lights. The shoot started at midnight and ran to around 3 or 4. He remembers finishing with Jazmin early, but he does not know what time she left. Stabler asks about the use of drugs on the set. Parisi tells him he has been sober for 17 months, four days. He then tells them he drives a Porche Boxer. Benson recognizes Parisi's assistant as Deborah Latrell, a victim of Ricky Blaine, \"The Measuring Man.\" They tell Stabler he would pose as a modeling scout and tell young girls he needed their measurements. After he gained their trust, he sexually assaulted them. Latrell tells Benson that she received a post card saying he was being released from Creedmore a few weeks prior.At Ricky Blaine's current job, they confiscate a hammer he has on him. He tells them he has not touched a piece of tape. He also tells them he was watching a football game, Jets against the Steelers, on television at the half-way house the night Jazmin was killed. Benson informs him the game was Cowboys against the 49ers. Blaine guesses Benson measurements before he tries to touch her face. Benson and Stabler take him down.Munch tells them Jazmin was booted from the photo shoot for failing a weigh-in.

When she sees the woman laying on the car without panties, she asks if anyone has called SVU and tells them to cover her up.When Stabler arrives on scene, a detective tells him he thinks it was a lovers' quarrel since there were no signs of forced entry and two sets of prints. Benson gives him a sarcastic version of events that may lead him to that conclusion, but she believes it to be rape. When he reminds her there were no signs of forced entry, she tells him she did not say it was a stranger. Stabler makes his threatening appearance known when the guy says she was not dressed in refusal outfit. He introduces himself and Benson causing the detective to concede it as their case and leaves. Benson shows Stabler a picture of the victim as they look out the window at her body on the car.In the squad room, Stabler looks at crime scene photographs while commenting on the eight-floor fall.

He reminds Cassidy of his court case the following day and tells him to notify him if he gets hung up.While Benson obtains some papers from the victims apartment, Stabler plays the outgoing message on her answering machine several times while acting like he is looking through her rolodex. On her way outside, Benson is told by  a resident of the building that she heard some noises and then the car alarm. When Benson asks if she saw anything, the woman suggests she is crazy for thinking she would look. When she walks away, the Cargills approach Benson asking inquiring into the amount of time the apartment would be held up as a crime scene stating they are next on the list for an apartment. Stabler overhears them as he is joining Benson. He asks for their name, tells them he is with the real estate board and they are off of the list and starts walking toward the car. As they walk, Benson and Stabler discuss the anonymity of the city.

Kathy and Stabler look at each other realizing it was just grided in the disposal.In court, Cassidy explains the defendant thought the victim was smiling at him when he got on the train so he sat next to her. When he received no response after trying to strike up a conversation with her, he assumed she was asleep, placed his hand in her blouse, and placed her hand on his genital region. He then made her rub him until he reached his intended goal. When the defense attorney clarifies for the jury that Cassidy works for SVU, he asks Cassidy for the technical term for 'fondling a stranger' to which Cassidy incorrectly responds it is 'fromage'.

Cragen tells them the pussyfooting is over.Benson and Stable return toe speak with Dr. Daniels with his lawyer brother present. The attorney tells them his brother would like to help them, but he is bound by privilege. They concede he was in her apartment, but clarifies it was for lunch to attend to a crisis. When Benson suggest he was there to attend to his erection, Dr. Daniels finds the statement insulting. Stabler comments he thought it was the absence of one that was insulting.

He explains he is off Saturday through Monday. He informs them he was having dinner with his wife and there is a room full of witnesses who can verify it. He offers them a picture of her if they need it, but asks for their discretion. As Benson and Stabler leave through the studio, Benson wonders if Warner is a sociopath or if he actually believes his own lines. Stabler goes with sociopath.

He claims he was shocked when they told him of her death, but Stabler disagrees saying he was cool. He tells them Gretchen called him crying so he asked her out for a drink. She tells him she had been sleeping with her shrink intensely for a couple of weeks. When Stabler asks why Gretchen would confide in him, Warner responds saying he is a good listener. Benson adds when he wants to get into someone's pants causing him to threaten to stop cooperating. When Warner attempts to end the interview, Stabler pulls Benson out of the room offering to bust him in the grill once they are in the hallway. Benson tells Stabler to try talking to him without her. After making sure they are okay, Stabler meets Warner on the balcony. Warner fills him in on what Gretchen had told him about her shrink. At first it was exhilarating since he knew all of her darkest secrets and fell for her anyway. Warner thought she should sue the shrink.

Before leaving, Stabler informs him he will be turned over to the Psychiatry Board.As Stabler gets ready for bed, he asks Kathy how you are suppose to warn children about the people they trust without causing them to be paranoid. She tells him Maureen miraculously made a B in Algebra and Kathleen may not need a full retainer. Stabler continues telling her the victim's father was abusing her as well as her shrink. When Kathy tells him Lizzie made him an ashtray, he reminds her he does not smoke. She tells him Dickie flushed it down the toilet anyway.Munch catches Benson as she arrives to work to let her know the victim's sister is in town. He reminds her chances are good she suffered the same abuse as Gretchen. Cassidy catches her getting coffee and informs her of what he learned about necrophilia. Munch pulls him away to teach him about compulsive onanism. Cragen breaks up the remaining detectives to send Benson and Stabler to an interview room to speak with the victim's sister.

      "corpus": "When Benson and Stabler arrive at the crime scene, they are greeted by Detective Frank Bremmer. He gives them a run down of the details as they walk over to the taxi cab that contains the body of a white male in his mid-30s. Bremmer tells them the victim has multiple stab wounds. They found $40 in a cigar box, $12 in his wallet, and a hack license made out to 'Victor Spicer', but no other I.D. When they ask what makes it a case for Special Victims, Bremmer informs them the victim's 'cigar' was cut off and the perpetrator took it.Cassidy comes into work late. Cragen informs them Van Buren wants everything they have on the case. Stabler tells Cragen the autopsy will be in the afternoon. Benson tells him Rodgers is the one performing it. Jeffries observes the lack of doubt in as to the cause of death. Munch tells them of a case he worked in Baltimore where the cause of death was not what they originally thought it was. When Briscoe informs Cragen they just received a call needing someone to cover a case about a dead body being molested, he sends Cassidy telling him to investigate, interrogate, and write up a DD-5. Cragen tells Munch to help Stabler and Benson. Benson tells him to follow up with the cab company. Benson says she will cover the Hack Bureau. Stabler informs them he has to go to court about a case involving a councilman.In court, the defense attorney makes it known that Stabler did not personally see the defendant expose himself. Stabler informs them he was pulled over by two of his neighbors reporting the incident and he arrested him because of their complaint. He explains he requested the Special Victims Unit because it is a major law enforcement problem. He also tells them he is the father of four and does not want them exposed to Mr. Kloster's 'shortcomings'. Kloster gets upset by this statement and in an effort to defend himself he unzips his pants and pulls out his 'shortcomings' for the entire courtroom to see.Stabler returns to the squad room with Benson's coffee and informs her Kloster is at Bellevue because he waved his flag and nobody saluted. Benson informs him the Hack Bureau suspended Spicer's license when he was put in Rikers Island for assault. When they tell Cragen this information, Benson also tells him she had the Watch Captain personally check to make sure he was there. When Stabler tells Cragen the case is there because the perpetrator sliced off the victim's 'unit', Cragen spits out the licorice he just bit off. Benson shows Cragen the hack license and tells him there was no other ID found. He looks at it with a magnifying glass while Stabler makes fun of him. Cragen takes out a knife and slices the laminate and removes the top picture making both Benson and Stabler look like idiots. He returns the license to them and tells them to go to Rikers and talk to the real Victor Spicer.Stabler informs him someone killed him in his cab. Benson asks who would want to cut his penis off. He tells her to take a number. When asked who had his license, he tells them he sold it to someone with a kid on Broadway for $100 that a foreign guy at Cabbie's Place set up. When he asks if Stabler is doing anything Saturday night, Stabler tells him he would hurt him.Benson informs Stabler patrol will check every apartment for ten blocks of Sara Beth's. She also suspects the guy's wife must be going nuts when Missing Persons will not take a report for another two days. Stabler wonders who was supposed to be sliced and diced. Benson thinks it was Spicer. At Cabbie's, they ask the waitress about the two Victors. She tells them she last saw the victim the night before. When they leave, they are stopped by Sikh. He tells them he saw the guy leave and saw two women hail his cab. The last thing he talked to him about was his wife and the fact they just found out his wife was expecting again.While Benson and Stabler discuss the case with Cragen, Munch tells them the cab dispatcher says they received a call inquiring about Spicer's working hours, but could not tell if it was a man or woman. Benson believes it was the real Victor Spicer that was supposed to be the one killed. Cragen asks who wanted him dead. Munch responds 'whoever called the dispatcher'. Benson and Stabler thank him for his insight as they leave to check on the residence of Steven Panacek.When they arrive, no one is home. Benson see the boy from a picture they recovered from the cab walking up the sidewalk with his mother. She asks about him but before they can say anything she figures out what is wrong from the looks on their faces and breaks down crying.While Stabler sits with the boy and listens to him read a book, Benson sits with Mrs. Panacek. She tells them he was C. He was illegal because when he spoke with an immigration lawyer, he was told he would still be deported. The little boy leaves Stabler and goes to hug his crying mother. Stabler gives his condolences before they leave.Stabler tells Cragen the ME found 37 stab wounds during the autopsy. The fingerprints came up clean in the US but Cragen wants them run through Interpol since he was illegal. Forensics found a fingernail with red fingernail polish on it. Cragen wants them to question the wives of Spicer's johns that were arrested. Cassidy and Munch are sent to question Mr. Dupree, but find out his wife is in a wheelchair. Benson and Stabler are sent to question an artist, but find that he and his wife have an open relationship and they were at Elaine's with some friends. He states his wife is bisexual and Benson should give her a call. When Munch finishes ranting about his latest conspiracy theory about JFK's coffin, Cragen tells them they got a fax from the FBI requesting anything they get about Internet crimes get sent to them in Baltimore. Munch goes off about going to Baltimore and the reason he hates Baltimore is he lost one of his wives to an affair she had with a co-worker of his. Stabler walks in and shows Cragen a report from Interpol. After reading it, Cragen tells Stabler his partner may have a problem with this victim, but to remind her they 'don't get to pick the vic'. Munch and Cassidy try to figure out what they missed while Stabler assures him it won't be a problem.Stabler tells Benson the victim was Stefan Tanzic, a Serb indicted for ethnic cleansing after raping 67 women. He tells her fifteen of them are still alive of which five live in the New York area. Rodgers brings Stabler and Benson back to the morgue to explain there were two weapons and two killers. Stabler and Benson return to the victim's wife and talk to her about their new found information after making sure their son was gone. When Benson asks her what it was like sleeping with someone who raped dozens of women, she threw them out. Once back outside Stabler informs her that was a dumb move considering if Mrs. Panacek says anything about what happened, Benson will lose her job. Stabler informs her Cragen is worried about her objectivity and if she gets removed from this case, she will be removed from the unit. She tells him she is a good cop.They go to visit Ileana Jashari. When they see she is blind and her face is horribly scarred, they ask if she knows Stefan Tanzic. She begins to cry and tells them he is the one that caused her looks. Benson tells her he is dead. When Benson finishes vomiting in the trash can, Stabler refers to a line from a Tom Hanks movie: 'There's no cryin' in baseball.' She reminds him Ileana could not have killed Tanzic and asks who is next. When they arrive at the next apartment, they are told Marta Stevens is at work and will return later. Before they leave, a little boy runs into the room. After inquiring, they deduce he is the product of Marta's rape. Stabler leaves Benson for a parent-teacher conference. As Benson walks, she calls for an address and goes to talk to Marta at work. She checks her hands for the missing nail. She informs her she has figured out Tanzic is her son's father. Marta gives her work as her alibi. She tells her Tanzic was murdered. Marta tells her about being raped for 23 days. While Stabler and Kathy are talking with Lizzie's teacher, Benson calls him. She tells him what happened. He tells her they will talk about it in the morning.  At dinner with her mother, Benson tells her about the case. Benson tells her mother she does not have a doubt in her mind that Marta killed Tanzic. When Benson tells her mother she wished she would have killed her rapist, her mother reminds her that if she had not been raped then she would not be here. She also reminds her the little boy needs his mother.Stabler tries to figure out how Benson believes Marta is innocent when she does not have an alibi. Benson slips by asking how they are going to find the 'other' killer. The next victim they check out was in Europe. The fourth victim, Anya Rugova, is blunt about knowing Tanzic and says she was at her restaurant, but her hand is hurt. When they leave, they agree the woman was lying about her alibi and not knowing Marta. Stabler points out that she was left-handed because when she wrote with her right hand it looked like a 5-year-old's writing. He believes they will get a DNA match on the nail. Benson tries to say the nail could have been in the cab for a month. Stabler explains his theory of what happened placing Marta and Rugova as the killers. Benson does not deny it. They take pictures of the women to the Sikh at Cabbie's. He cannot tell if it is the women who hailed Tanzic's cab. He is sure the women saw him though. Stabler wants to arrest them. They arrest Marta at work and call for another car to meet them at Rugova's restaurant saying they have a positive ID. At the restaurant while Benson stays outside with Marta telling her not to talk without a lawyer, Cassidy and Munch pull up ready to transport her to the station. Stabler tells Rugova about the fingernail, tells her she is under arrest, and begins telling her of her rights when she asks to call her lawyer. When she heads for the phone, she grabs a knife and stabs herself. Stabler tries to stop the bleeding while Benson leaps over the rail and calls for an ambulance. She whispers something in Elliot's ear after telling him not to help her.Marta tells ADA Abbie Carmichael, Benson, and Stabler what happened. She explains she was the first to recognize his voice, but Rugova was the first to stab him. They kept stabbing him while their minds relived the rapes.When they come out of the interrogation room, Carmichael tells them she will plead out to Manslaughter 2 and will get 18-months in a psychiatric facility. When Cragen asks if they are okay with that, Benson and Stabler say they are. He orders them to his office when Carmichael leaves. Cragen explains he does not believe it was a manslaughter case saying the evidence was stronger than that. Benson says they did the one thing that will allow her to sleep. Cragen tells her she used her 'get out of jail free card' on this case. When they return to their desks, Benson asks Stabler what Rugova told him. He says, 'I just want to be with my family'."
