A party across the hall gives them the opportunity to question several people as possible suspects, but none of them are the killer.  Following a red herring, they spend time tracking down one of the victim's drug (heroin) connections but to no avail.  Going back to square one, they decide the killer had access to the building because they couldn't find anyone who buzzed him or her in before the murders.During the re-canvassing they discover a tenant saw a workman leaving the building.  Adding this question to their canvassing, they come up with another red herring but zone in on the workman's clothing.  This leads them to a locksmith business with access to the building and to the locks.  Upon future questioning Briscoe and Green decide to look deeper into the locksmith's nephew.Going to the suspect's apartment, they discover he lives with his mother.  After talking their way into his room, they find newspaper clippings of recent crimes, which gravely concerns them.  Tracking the nephew down at a nearby pharmacy proves today is not our hero's day.  A routine pick-up turns into a hostage situation and the basis for the courtroom side of the show. The nephew requests a lawyer (as in one will be appointed for you).  Assistant District Attorney Southerlyn decides this is her opportunity to assist and to obtain a confession.  She tells the suspect she is a lawyer and shows her bar membership card.  She specifically avoids showing her D.A. badge.  Thinking he is talking to his lawyer instead of the city's lawyer, he confesses.  She talks him into freeing the hostage and giving up by implying she will get him a good deal.The nephew's real lawyer discovers from his client that Ms. Southerlyn is his legal representative.  The new lawyer attempts to have the confession thrown out because it should be a privileged communication between a lawyer and a client, even if the lawyer is a DA.  The Judge finds the confession admissible because the hostage was a third party, which negated the client-lawyer privilege. The nephew's lawyer failed to make a case that Ms. Southerlyn's representation was ineffective as she failed to inform him a third party would negate the client-lawyer privilege and hence the confession was still inadmissible.McCoy negotiates the crimes to murder two, instead of murder one because of this plot twist.The New York Disciplinary Committee receives a complaint from the nephew and his lawyer about Ms. Southerlyn's behavior and says she violated section DR 1-102 of the New York Bar Associations Rules and Ethics.  McCoy represents her, as no private attorney will take the case, at the hearing.  In the meantime their boss suspends her pending the results of the hearing.  Facing disbarment Ms. Southerlyn must face the day and her decision over again.  McCoy's argues the ends justify the means and the court should allow district attorneys the same rights to lie as the police got from the courts.  The panel rules against Ms. Southerlyn and Mr. McCoy saying the ends can never ever justify the means.  Society must have the ethics of lawyers and the court to protect them from anarchy and nothing justifies the breaking the code of ethics.  Clearly, Ms. Southerlyn actions saved the hostage but her obtaining the confession went too far.  The panel finds her guilty of violating section D 1-102 but does not disbar her.  They recommend to the appeals court she receives a private letter of reprimand.  Her boss reinstates her to the court calendar, as the show ends."},{"episode_title":"Undercovered","nth_episode":12,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/undercovered-108236\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Collar","nth_episode":11,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-collar-108235\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Prejudice","nth_episode":10,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/prejudice-101749\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"3 Dawg Night","nth_episode":9,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/3-dawg-night-97627\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Fire This Time","nth_episode":8,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-fire-this-time-97619\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Myth of Fingerprints","nth_episode":7,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/myth-of-fingerprints-94103\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Formerly Famous","nth_episode":6,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/formerly-famous-88491\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Possession","nth_episode":5,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/possession-85431\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Soldier of Fortune","nth_episode":4,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/soldier-of-fortune-80324\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"For Love or Money","nth_episode":3,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/for-love-or-money-80323\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Armed Forces","nth_episode":2,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/armed-forces-78049\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Who Let the Dogs Out?","nth_episode":1,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/who-let-the-dogs-out-73305\/recap","nth_season":12,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""}]}
