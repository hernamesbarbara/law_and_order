The medical examiner determines that though the victim did fall down the stairs, being hit in the head with a golf club is what killed him. Briscoe and Green meet with the woman he was supposed to meet up with the day he was killed, and are led to a store that sells high-priced women's clothing. From there they meet two women; the first has a solid alibi, and the second is Lindsay, a photographer who is also the victim's girlfriend. Lindsay claims she was at a photo shoot with cosmetics mogul Jackie Scott, which is confirmed by Jackie. Upon a review of the victim's client list, A.D.A. Serena discovers that Jackie Scott is Lindsay's mother and that both of them were sleeping with the victim. Briscoe and Green talk to Lindsay's nanny, which leads them to a picture that Lindsay took of a marathon the day the victim was killed proving that she was not at the photoshoot at all. Briscoe and Green confront Jackie with this fact, and Jackie confirms that she was having an affair with her daughter's boyfriend when Lindsay appears. Lindsay then recants her story and said that the only reason she said that was because she knew her mom would be at her office and when Briscoe and Green ask if she killed the victim because he was sleeping with her mother, Lindsay says she didn't know anything about an affair. Briscoe and Green return to Jackie's office to ask her where she really was when Jackie storms in with cards that had accidently been delivered to her, revealing to Lindsay that her mother was sleeping with the victim\/her boyfriend. Lindsay then burst outs saying that she was the one who killed the victim.Later, Jackie meets with D.A. Arthur and asks him to forget the case because they're old friends, but Arthur refuses. Back at the DA's office Arthur says that he's suspicious of Jackie and has Serena look into Jackie and why she would have killed the victim. When Serena reviews Jackie's stocks, she discovers that Jackie sold all of her stock in one company days before the company's stocks fell, revealing that Jackie had inside information. Further research into the matter reveals that Jackie could only sell certain stocks if the victim allowed her to, i.e. her motive for killing the vicitim.In order to get condemning evidence on Jackie, Arthur has Lindsay released but has her phone wiretapped, which provides them with the evidence they need. At arraignment, Jackie is put under house arrest, is forced to wear a tracking device and loses her passport. Lindsay comes to Arthur's office and begs him to help Jackie, but Arthur refuses. Jackie's lawyer asks that Jackie be given an evaluation to see if hormone replacement therapy withdrawal could have caused her to kill the victim, and is evaluated by Dr. Emil Skoda and Dr. Elizabeth Olivet. After the evaluation is over, McCoy decides to use Dr. Olivet as a witness and not Dr. Skoda.At trial, Jack McCoy asks Dr. Olivet if Jackie's hormone problems could trigger her to kill and Olivet says no. Jackie's lawyer tries to make Olivet seem unqualifed, and asks if she has the right education to make an evaluation. Then to McCoy's surprise, Dr. Skoda is called by the defense, and discovers that they forgot to take him off their witness list. The defense asks Dr. Skoda if sleep deprived people are more likely to kill or cause acts of violence, to which Skoda says that the sleep deprived are more likely to attack someone. McCoy then asks Dr. Skoda if being sleep deprived would cause someone to kill, to which Dr. Skoda says no. Jackie is finally put on the stand and says she has no memory of killing the victim. McCoy asks if she remembered how she got there and how she got home, and Jackie says she does and that she even remembers tipping the cab driver. McCoy says that it's ironic that she would remember tipping the cab, but not killing the victim.Later, Arthur offers Jackie a deal, Manslaughter One, but Jackie doesn't take it. However, when Arthur reveals that he'd like to cross-examine her himself, asking about every little thing, Jackie caves and takes the deal."},{"episode_title":"Star Crossed","nth_episode":14,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/star-crossed-226471\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Absentia","nth_episode":13,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/absentia-226470\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Under God","nth_episode":12,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/under-god-226469\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Chosen","nth_episode":11,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/chosen-219635\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Mother's Day","nth_episode":10,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/mothers-day-219155\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Wheel","nth_episode":9,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-wheel-210019\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"*","nth_episode":8,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/episode-210018\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Open Season","nth_episode":7,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/open-season-203599\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Hitman","nth_episode":6,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/hitman-195998\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Ring","nth_episode":5,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-ring-195997\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Tragedy on Rye","nth_episode":4,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/tragedy-on-rye-194177\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"True Crime","nth_episode":3,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/true-crime-189359\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Shangri-La","nth_episode":2,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/shangri-la-186956\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"American Jihad","nth_episode":1,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/american-jihad-178750\/recap","nth_season":13,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""}]}
