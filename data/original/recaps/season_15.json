Fontana and Falco arrive and they ask witnesses, but no one knows anything. One witness says he saw someone outside, and, while he can't give a description, he says the man was wearing a jacket with a triangle on the back.At the morgue, Fontana thinks the man is jockey.So Fontana and Falco go to the track. They learn his name is Oscar Salazar and that he's from Panama. Everyone says he's impulsive. They think that he may have been having a dispute with Cass Holloman, one of the trainers, who may have been doing something illegal to win. When they confront the trainer, he has an alibi. Later they learn he was supposed to ride a horse that some say has potential, but Cass Holloman says he did no such thing. They also discover he wears a jacket that has a \"V\" logo on the bag which could be mistaken for a triangle. They later learn from another jockey that Holloman asked Salazar to meet him at the bar. When they question him, he says he wasn't the one who saw Salazar, it was the owner Edgar Varick. They ask him what this is all about. He says that it's about Varick's horse, Rasputin. Salazar, who once rode him, thought he was a winner and if he rode him, it could make his career. But Varick wouldn't allow it. So Salazar started inquiring about Rasputin's blood line. It seems like Varick claims he paid around $30,000 for Rasputin, but Holloman thinks he's worth at least a 100 times that. They arrest Varick.Later, McCoy wonders why Varick is so antsy about the horse. So he has Alex check out Varick's finances and discovers Varick has not moved any money. She wonders if maybe he got money for the purchase from his family. She talks to his mother who says she's the sole owner of the company, and all he gets is a salary. She says that once in a while he has her sign papers for the company pension fund. Alex also learns that Varick actually paid $3 million for the horse.Alex determines Varick stole from the company's pension fund when they gave him permission to move the pension fund to a mutual fund, which allowed him to access it. The company foreman, who's also a trustee of the pension fund, is upset to learn of this.At the trial, the foreman blows up in court, jeopardizing the case. Later, Varick doesn't show up in court. So the judge issues a bench warrant for his arrest. When he doesn't turn up, McCoy decides to repossess everything he owns—including Rasputin—to restore the company's pension fund. Later, Varick's car is found at the airport and taken to impound. When they do an inventory search, they find Varick in the trunk dead, shot in the head."},{"episode_title":"Publish and Perish","nth_episode":21,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/publish-and-perish-417025\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Tombstone","nth_episode":20,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/tombstone-411954\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Sects","nth_episode":19,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/sects-410990\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Dining Out","nth_episode":18,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/dining-out-400277\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"License to Kill","nth_episode":17,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/license-to-kill-400276\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Sixth Man","nth_episode":16,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-sixth-man-400275\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Obsession","nth_episode":15,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/obsession-383905\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Fluency","nth_episode":14,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/fluency-381744\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Ain't No Love","nth_episode":13,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/aint-no-love-378845\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Mammon","nth_episode":12,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/mammon-376518\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Fixed","nth_episode":11,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/fixed-372086\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Enemy","nth_episode":10,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/enemy-372087\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"All in the Family","nth_episode":9,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/all-in-the-family-370155\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Cry Wolf","nth_episode":8,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/cry-wolf-365487\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Gov Love","nth_episode":7,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/gov-love-367452\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Cut","nth_episode":6,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/cut-362618\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Gunplay","nth_episode":5,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/gunplay-356601\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Coming Down Hard","nth_episode":4,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/coming-down-hard-355114\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Brotherhood","nth_episode":3,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-brotherhood-349982\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"The Dead Wives Club","nth_episode":2,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/the-dead-wives-club-348496\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""},{"episode_title":"Paradigm","nth_episode":1,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/paradigm-346552\/recap","nth_season":15,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""}]}
