After talking to the company owner, Jason Rundberg, they get a name for the user, REwind99. They question the husband and daughter, which leads them to Bill Walker, a former lover. He hasn't seen Caroline in months. Their investigation leads them to a lingerie shop, where they finally get a lead on REwind99 -- he turns out to be a paranoid schizophrenic named Richard Elam. In the meanwhile, Molly Preston turns up missing. After speaking with Elam's mother, they manage to track Elam to a motel with the help of an Amber Alert that had been put out on Molly. They arrest Elam, who screams about being Molly's savior as he is being arrested, and Cassady comforts a hysterical Molly who says that Elam raped her.After Elam's arraigment, his attorney wants to talk to Rubirosa. He provides information to her showing that Elam was coerced into the killing by Molly herself, who had used her B-Frendz.com website to complain about her mother all the time, claiming her mother horribly abused her. After checking out the website itself and proving what Elam is saying, Green and Cassady go to Molly's school and arrest her.Molly insists she is innocent of any wrong-doing, and her father insists that anything she may have done she did because of the website. Although Rubirosa is convinced that Molly is fully aware of the consequences of her actions, McCoy isn't so sure the jury will agree. When Stewart brings Jason Rundberg on the stand and accuses him (as owner of B-Frendz.com) of being responsible for the murder because he had received complaints about Molly's site, McCoy and Rubirosa learn that she only introduced three of the four e-mails received into evidence. Researching the fourth e-mail leads them to university football player Gregg Robinson. Robinson is unwilling to talk, but Rundberg hands over the full e-mail.Robinson takes the stand at Molly's trial, where he states that he IM'd her after seeing her blog posting where she offered her body to anyone who would kill her mother. He stated he had sex with her, never assuming she was serious, and then after realising she was e-mailed the site. McCoy and Rubirosa again offered Molly a deal, ten years, which her father tried to get her to accept but she refused.When the verdict came in, Molly Preston was convicted of second degree murder."},{"episode_title":"Fame","nth_episode":1,"corpus_url":"http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/law-order\/fame-866775\/recap","nth_season":17,"source":"http:\/\/www.tv.com","show":"original","corpus":""}]}
