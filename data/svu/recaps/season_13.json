The guard is known to force patients to have sex with him. When they go to question Charles, he tells them that Gia had asked him for a gun and that she had given him consensual oral sex.

George is later arrested for impersonating a doctor to have access to the facility.The officers question George and he tells them that he is in love with his niece.
