He claims he didn't do anything but they have his fingerprints at the scene of the rape of Carrie Huitt. Gardner is also being linked to three other separate rapes, and continues to claim his innocence. He has a good attorney, Erin Russ. Carrie picks Gardner out of a line up, while Bethany Taylor her rape crisis counselor stands by her side. Gardner is out on bail and he continues to stalk two of his victims. Benson and Stabler catch him stalking Karen Leighton and arrest him again. This time, he decides to go pro se. Gardner argues the rape crisis counselor coached Carrie into picking the right person and he also successfully argues to sever all the cases. With no real evidence on three of the four cases, he is now down to one. But he doesn't show up for court one day and Cabot is concerned he left town. Stabler receives a phone call alerting him Gardner has struck again, this time killing his victim. Benson realizes he's getting smarter, because now there's nobody to I.D. him. After going through his financial files, the detectives realize he cashed a huge check in the Bronx while on the lam. Security cameras show him getting into Russ' vehicle and kissing her. It turns out he's been having an affair with her. They go to her apartment, and find her with blood on her hands. She's driven a knife through Gardner and he's dead.

      "corpus": "A resident at a Hell's Kitchen apartment building calls the fire department after smelling smoke in another unit. Firefighters break down the door and find food burning on the stove, a frightened six-year-old boy named Mikey, and his badly injured mother. The mother had also been raped and sodomized. Barely alive when the fire department arrived, she dies at the hospital during surgery.   The mother's purse and all other identifying information were taken by her attacker. A urine stain on the hallway carpet outside the bedroom suggests that Mikey witnessed the assault, and was so terrified by what he saw that he wet his pants.The apartment landlord identifies the mother as Dana McGuire. She had moved in a month ago, paying  cash up front for three months. Her driver's license had listed an upscale Central Park address.Dana McGuire is alive and well at the address on the license. Her purse had been stolen in a mugging some time before. The mugger, who's serving six months at Rikers, met \"Dana\" in a diner and gave her the license after she told him she couldn't find work because she had no ID. He knew her as Jill, and her son as Tommy. Warner determines that Jill probably hadn't been able to have children, and that Tommy definitely isn't her biological child. Tommy likes to draw, and he draws pictures of Jill's murder and of himself holding hands with Olivia. Olivia tries to draw him out about what happened to Jill. He reaches for her cell phone, and she gives it to him. He dials 911. Olivia asks Tommy if he knows his home number, and he tosses the phone down on the table. When she asks if he knows any other numbers, such as those one might call in an emergency, he dials the Domestic Violence Hotline.A compassionate hotline worker identifies Jill as Jill Hoffman, and expresses her disgust that Jill's husband \"finally did it.\" Dan Hoffman is a violent, abusive monster who completely isolated Jill from the world. After three weeks at a safe house, Jill returned home long enough to get Tommy. But then the domestic violence workers couldn't shelter her, because as Tommy's stepmother she had no legal right to take the boy from his father. They did find her a pro bono attorney to help her fight for legal custody.The attorney tells Elliot and Olivia that Dan started abusing Jill shortly after their wedding two years ago.  Kim, Dan's first wife and Tommy's biological mother, had left a year before that; Dan probably abused her too. Dan had psychologically terrorized his son, but hadn't laid a hand on him -- yet. Jill had known that Dan's crossing that line was only a matter of time  She'd never made a domestic violence complaint because her husband is Mr. Pillar-of-the-Community in their exclusive small town of Rye. Who would believe he's a batterer?Tommy tells Olivia that he and Jill had run away from his father. Jill was going to find them a new home, someplace far away where his father wouldn't find them. Just as Tommy is going to talk about Jill's murder, Dan Hoffman storms in. Tommy is clearly terrified, but he's been medically cleared and released to the custody of his father.Dan's alibi for the night of Jill's murder is being at a business association dinner dance. The event was held at a place only five minutes from Jill's apartment. Several attendees confirm that Dan was there. They also remember that he disappeared for about 45 minutes during the evening, then reappeared.Alex Cabot tries, unsuccessfully, to get court permission for George Huang to interview Tommy. To prove he's not the monster the police think he is, Dan submits to a police interview. He plays the loving father and grieving widower only too well for Elliot and Olivia's taste, having the right answer for every question they ask. When Olivia tells him she doesn't buy his act, his good-guy mask slips just a bit as he replies, \"You wouldn't dare talk to me that way if you didn't have that badge and gun.\"Munch finds a new checking account in the name of Dana McGuire, but it's actually Jill's. She had deposited some paychecks from Benny's Topless into the account. Another Benny's entertainer tells Elliot and Olivia that although Jill was a lousy dancer, she was hired because she looked like \"Susie Homemaker.\" Many of  Benny's customers are commuters who stop in before heading home to the suburbs. Jill quit in a panic the previous week, after seeing someone from her former hometown in the crowd one night.  The credit card receipts from that night lead to a Mr. Rizzo, from Rye. To keep his wife from finding out he's not working heavy overtime, he gladly reveals that he told Dan Hoffman about the Benny's stripper who looked exactly like Jill. Rizzo figured it was a great laugh.Elliot and Olivia talk to Alex Cabot, pointing out that once Dan knew where Jill worked, all he had to do was follow her home. Their circumstantial information is enough for an arrest, but Dan's a very handsome, successful, charismatic man, fully capable of charming a grand jury into not indicting him. Therefore Alex obtains a \"silent indictment\", which gets Dan indicted and arrested for Jill's murder, without giving him an opportunity to testify before the grand jury. The case against Dan takes a major bad turn when the judge won't allow the domestic violence workers to testify that Jill told hem she was being abused. Tommy's testimony would convict his father, but SVU is still barred from talking to the boy. Alex asks about Kim Hoffman, who as Tommy's biological mother has every right to talk to him. Elliot replies that SVU hasn't been able to find her. Captain Cragen tells the detectives to find someone who'd known Kim.Allen Wheaten, the Hoffmans' longtime neighbor, knew Kim was being physically abused because he'd seen the injuries. He believes Dan murdered Kim, because late one night he saw a van pull into the Hoffmans' driveway. Someone filled the van with garbage bags and drove off. The next day, Kim was gone. Wheaten contacted the Rye police with the van's license plate number and his suspicion that Kim was murdered. The van belonged to a Dawn Trent, a soccer mom from Port Chester who said she'd been delivering Girl Scout cookies. Case closed.Dawn Trent tells Elliot that she had helped Kim escape that night from her abusive situation. Kim didn't take Tommy with her then because Dan was on the verge of killing her; she had to leave fast. She hoped to return for her son once she was settled elsewhere. Dawn belongs to a group which rescues domestic violence victims and passes them from one person to another, eventually resettling them far away from their abusers. All any rescuer knows is the next link in the chain.  Elliot follows the chain of Kim's rescuers, locates Kim and tells her everything that's happened. She tearfully tells him she had gone back for Tommy, only to see him happily playing on the front lawn with Jill and calling her \"Mommy.\" Kim then thought he was better off there, because what did she have to offer him. Elliot persuades her to come back for Tommy's sake. If she doesn't, Dan will be acquitted of Jill's murder; and Tommy will be returned to his father.At the courthouse where Dan's trial is in progress, Kim talks to Tommy in the hallway. The bond between mother and son is reestablished. When Tommy is called to testify, he and his mother walk into the courtroom together. On the witness stand Tommy is too terrified of his father to speak, and the judge allows him to step down without testifying. As Alex leads Tommy past the defense table to leave, Dan flashes him a big smile and says, \"I love you, son.\" Tommy looks at his mother sitting nearby, then quietly says to his father, \"You killed Jill.\" Dan's lawyer immediately asks for a mistrial, as the judge calls for order in the court among the murmuring observers. Dan's good-guy mask slips off as he coldly says, \"Tommy, you listen to me. Don't do this.\" Tommy turns to Alex and says, \"I'm ready. I can do this now.\"Dan Hoffman can only watch in silent, seething rage as Tommy returns to the witness stand. As Tommy sits down, he glares at his father with a steely, righteous defiance that not even Dan's most violent abusive fury will shake."

      "corpus": "Detectives Benson and Stabler are called to a crime scene where a young woman in a maid's uniform has jumped to her death from a high-rise apartment building. Suicide was initially determined to be the cause of death, but the sexually related bruising causes them to question whether she had been pushed.The woman is identified as a film student, Carmen Trancoso. Her face had been destroyed by the fall, so the detectives initially identifier her as Anna Rivera, a former maid at the Lamerly's penthouse. The detectives learn Carmen had been dating the Lamerly's son, Drew, but the relationship had gotten too intense. Drew broke it off with her and Carmen began to stalk him. Benson and Stabler visit the attorneys who were representing Carmen, who was trying to sue Drew for rape. However, Drew is prepared with his lawyer Lorna Scarry, who refutes Carmen's claim. As they dig into Drew's past, it is revealed he had been expelled from a private school. The detectives learn Drew's prom date, Jenny White, also claims Drew had raped her. Jenny had been a prostitute at the time and is now married to a rich and powerful man. Because of this, she hesitates to come forward. Then investigators now believe Carmen did not jump – she had been pushed. Drew claims the family's head of security, Tom Paysen, had killed Carmen.The detectives bring Drew in for an evaluation by Dr. Huang and a lie detector test, but he almost does too well on it. Then finally a break, a rare material traced to a jacket in his closet is found on the victim. Drew is placed under arrest. Scarry attempts to get Cabot to cut a deal. When that doesn't work, she claims he is not guilty by virtue of diminished capacity because his father was highly abusive. Drew's grandmother, Candace, tries to make the case on the stand, but Cabot claims in the abuse from his father never came up in Drew's polygraph. The judge rules against Cabot and allows the testimony. Since it was privileged information, Cabot refuses to be defeated.The detectives go to Jenny White Rochester and convince her to testify. They now realize it was Drew's grandmother, who was the ringleader, and not his father.  Candace had groomed Drew to be the violent man that he is. Candace is now in as much trouble as her grandson, whose defense has been rejected by the court."

      "corpus": "A cooler containing a dead one-month old infant girl is found in the Hudson River near Battery Park.  A plastic bag tied to the cooler handle had contained weights, which broke through the bag and allowed the cooler to float to the surface. Warner determines that the infant died only a day ago of a lethal dose of tricyclic antidepressants, which aren't prescribed to nursing mothers. But in all other respects this child had been well cared for, so she wasn't a throwaway.Algae, sodium hypochlorite, and a partial logo on the bag narrow down the geographic area where the cooler was placed into the river. Hudson University is in that area. For lack of any other profile, SVU initially seeks out college students away from home who'd faced an unplanned pregnancy.  When the university medical center insists on a subpoena before it will identify students who'd had pregnancy tests there, Elliot and Olivia seek one from Alex Cabot. Alex doesn't think they have grounds for it, but reluctantly agrees to ask her boss. To her surprise, SVU Bureau Chief Elizabeth Donnelly insists on getting the subpoena. Donnelly is ends-justify-the-means incensed that this mother didn't make use of the state's hard-won Baby Safe Haven law to give up her child safely, without fear of prosecution.  A judge issues the subpoena, and the detectives -- Munch unwillingly -- visit the named students to ask about their pregnancies.Several invasions of privacy later, Warner determines that the dead infant had Tay-Sachs disease. This was a mercy killing. A medical researcher tells Elliot and Olivia that symptoms the parents would have noticed wouldn't have appeared for about six months. However, the eye discoloration of Tay-Sachs is visible very soon after birth. Any pediatrician would have seen it during a well-baby checkup. Fortunately the disease is rare, so much so that there's only one support group in the area.Elliot and Olivia visit the support group and tell the rabbi they're looking for a local couple with a one-month-old child. The rabbi remembers one woman from Manhattan who had attended recently. She came only once and had been referred by her child's pediatrician, Dr. Judah Platner. The doctor is a member of the rabbi's congregation.Dr. Platner refuses to reveal any information about the woman. A check with the Vital Statistics Bureau reveals that the previous week, Platner had signed a death certificate for a Sarah Brown, who died at one month of age from asphyhxiation pneumonia. Elliot and Olivia visit the bereaved parents, Daniel and Andrea Brown. Olivia asks to use the bathroom, and finds in the trash an empty bottle of the adult antidepressant Imipramine -- prescribed for Andrea Brown the previous week by Dr. Platner.Warner confirms that Imipramine is the tricyclic that killed Sarah Brown. Alex gets a warrant for the discarded prescription bottle, which in turn is sufficient grounds for opening Sarah's grave. The Browns buried an empty casket. Andrea Brown and Dr. Platner are both brought in for questioning.  A DNA test confirms the dead infant was Sarah Brown. Andrea says she acted alone in killing her daughter, and is charged with murder. Platner is charged with supplying the murder weapon, the antidepressant. The doctor staunchly defends his actions. After watching countless other children die terrible deaths, in Sarah's case at least he was able to do something before she suffered. Dr. Platner testifies that he was Andrea's pediatrician from the day she was born, and sort of a surrogate father after her own father died. When he told her and Daniel that Sarah had Tay-Sachs disease, they felt very guilty over never being tested themselves. He also says both of them wanted to end Sarah's suffering, though he acknowledges having spoken directly only to Andrea about it. She was determined to euthanize Sarah with or without Dr. Platner's help. So he helped her in order to make things as painless as possible for both of them.Andrea testifies she had acted alone in ending Sarah's life, saying she didn't want her husband to be the one who did it. Later, Alex sees the Browns and Platner arguing outside the courtroom. Platner's attorney tells Alex his client wants to make a deal. Baffled by Platner's suddenly throwing in the towel, Alex and her boss say they'll sleep on it. Alex tells the detectives that Platner had seemed surprised when Andrea testified she'd acted alone. Munch wonders why the Browns, who must have known the risk of Tay-Sachs, weren't tested for the gene before they married. Answer: There had been no need for testing if Daniel Brown wasn't born Jewish. Confronted with a court order for a DNA sample from him, Daniel acknowledges that he's Jewish by conversion, and that he's not Sarah's biological father. He'd suspected an affair when Sarah was diagnosed, but he didn't know for certain until Andrea told him following her arrest.In her closing argument to the jury, Andrea's attorney portrays her client as a loving mother who'd done what she did solely to spare Sarah a life of horrible agony.  She asks the jurors to ask themselves, \"If this were my child, what would I do?\"Alex portrays Andrea as a self-centered woman who sought to conceal her infidelity by eliminating the proof of it. She didn't tell her husband he wasn't her child's father, once she knew.  She didn't tell Sarah's father he had a child. She pressured Dr. Platner to engage in criminal conduct to help her end Sarah's life. Since Sarah had not yet begun showing noticeable signs of Tay-Sachs, the longer she lived, the more likely someone was likely to find out the truth. This was no mercy killing, but a clear-cut case of murder. The jury convicts Andrea Brown of second-degree murder, which carries 25 years to life. Munch, who's against euthanizing children, congratulates Alex on her victory. Alex doesn't feel victorious, saying she won only by portraying Andrea as a whore. She asks Munch the defense's question:  \"If it had been your child, what would you have done?\" Munch answers, \"Whatever I could.\""

      "corpus": "A woman runs out of her apartment, holding her baby and screaming that he is not breathing. Benson and Stabler are called to the hospital, where they are told that the baby is suffering a cocaine overdose. The mother denies giving her baby the coke, and the doctor is able to tell them that the drug seems to have been mixed in with the baby formula. The mother admits that she borrowed a can of formula from a couple whose apartment she cleans.Benson and Stabler rush to the home of the Pfeiffers, who have a baby boy, and take away all the other cans of the baby formula for testing, as well as seizing those from the market where the Pfeiffers bought them. The lab reveals that one of the cans from the Pfeiffers' apartment contains 90% liquid cocaine, and that the baby formula was drained from the can before it was filled with the drug. None of the other cans, or the ones from the market, are tainted.The FDA issues a recall of all the baby food of that brand, while the detectives are able to determine that the tainted cans came, not from the company's American plant, but from Mexico. A little more digging reveals that Derek Pfeiffer was bankrupt, until recently, when he mysteriously was able to pay off all his debts. They then get a message that the baby suffering from an overdose has died.Munch and Tutuola go to speak to Derek Pfeiffer, who admits he was in Mexico, but to see a business client (he is some sort of Wall Street/investments person). Munch and Tutuola tell him to go with them to the police station, but as they are putting him in a car outside the building, internal affairs officers take him into their car. One of the officers, Tucker, tells them that Cregan signed off on it, and that he told them where to find the detectives.Cregan is furious when he hears what Tucker said, as he by no means gave IA the okay to take Pfeiffer. They storm into internal affairs where Cregan loses his temper. He instructs Stabler to try and find out what interest IA have in the case and tells him to pick up Derek Pfeiffer again, since IA has released him. When Benson and Stabler go to Pfeiffer's office, they find police officers already there, and find Pfeiffer strangled with a cord in the bathrooms on his floor.Munch and Tutuola speak to Keith Gerard, Pfeiffer's immediate boss, who tells them that the security in the building should not have allowed this to happen. Meanwhile, Benson and Stabler talk to Mrs. Pfeiffer who says that she knows nothing about her husband's work, nor how he found the money to pay off their debts. The detectives offer her protection, but she says she will take her son and go to stay with her sister. She admits, nervously, that a man came to the door, asking for the formula, and showed her a police badge.Tucker hears that SVU are still investigating the case and comes to speak to Cregan. He admits that several undercover operations aimed at cracking the baby formula ring have failed, and a dirty cop is suspected. Cregan insists that it remains SVU's case, and that their detectives will handle the undercover work.Stabler is chosen to go undercover as he looks like the 'clean-cut, corporate type.' He goes to a bar where they suspect Derek did his business, and (with Benson inside the bar as backup), he allows the barman to see that he has some cocaine with him. The barman refers him to another man sitting at the end of the bar, whom Stabler follows into the bathroom, where he is roughed up a little, then made an offer. They arrange to meet at a dock to do business.At the dock, another man shows up. Stabler is searched, then shown some cocaine which the two men offer to supply to him to sell at his office building. When he agrees to the deal, one of the men pulls out a gold shield and bundles him into the car and they drive away. Munch, Cregan, Benson and Tutuola, who are in other cars as backup, follow. The car stops, and Stabler is taken out and beaten up, so that the man with the badge can show he is 'top dog'. The man tells Stabler his name is Kendall and that Stabler now has to help them smuggle drugs from Mexico. They then drive away and leave Stabler there.Back at the station, the detectives look at Kendall's record. He is a decorated detective, who seems to have gone off the rails after a bad shooting incident. Stabler meets with Kendall again, in a restaurant, and they discuss money. Kendall reveals that he will have to take Stabler's demands to his boss, and that he will get back to him.Kendall calls Stabler with the mission; to find a reason to go to Mexico for business, and pick up some tiles made with cocaine, his cover story being that he is re-tiling his kitchen. Since Mexico is out of their jurisdiction, someone else is to pick up the tiles and they will then be delivered to Stabler's undercover house in Queens.The tiles are delivered by Munch, pretending to be a delivery man, and Stabler is just about to hand them over to Kendall when Benson comes out of the house, posing as Stabler's wife. As the delivery truck comes back towards the house, Kendall realises it is a sting and runs. Stabler follows him and draws his gun and when Kendall turns his gun on him he is forced to shoot him dead. IAB investigate the shooting and Tucker places Stabler on modified assignment until they sort things out- he is confined to the office and cannot arrest or interrogate anyone. Meanwhile, DNA from the cord which was used to kill Derek Pfeiffer is a match to Kendall, who was probably working on a higher-up dealer's orders.The detectives discover that when Derek Pfeiffer flew to Mexico, his wife and the baby also flew there, but on a different airline. They realise that Mrs. Pfeiffer was the mule, as no one would suspect a mother carrying cans of baby formula.Benson and Cregan (since Stabler cannot leave the office) go to speak again with Pfeiffer's boss, Keith Gerard, about whether Pfeiffer's trips to Mexico were for legitimate business. He says that they were, but reveals that the Pfeiffers did not have children. Cregan speculates that whoever payed the Pfeiffers to smuggle drugs, probably has a ring of mothers with babies doing the same thing.Benson and Cregan then go to Staten Island, to speak to Mrs. Pfeiffer at her sister's house. They can hear the baby crying, and find a window broken, and so they break the door open. They find the baby distressed but unharmed, and find Mrs. Pfeiffer and her sister shot dead in the kitchen. They discover that the baby is Mrs. Pfeiffer's nephew, and that Mrs. Pfeiffer was planning a one-way trip to Brazil to avoid prosecution.The detectives begin tracking down similar cases where parents of babies have been killed execution-style. Stabler becomes very frustrated by this task, and is busy yelling at Munch when Kathy comes in to bring him something to eat.Cregan and Benson are called to a house in Queens were there has just been a murder which fits the pattern they are looking at- new parents shot dead. There appear to be no signs of forced entry. They discover that the father was a landscaper for Keith Gerard, and realise that he is in charge of the smuggling ring and has probably ordered the killings of all the parents in the ring so there are no witnesses against him.Benson and Cregan go to Gerard's office, where his secretary tells them that he is down in the corporate day care centre. They catch him walking out with a mother with a baby, and when Gerard sees them, he pulls a gun on the mother and holds her and her baby as a shield. Cregan and Benson lower their weapons, as if to let Gerard get away. He pushes the mother and her baby away and runs, but is stopped by Tutuola, who had snuck up behind him. They arrest him for murder.Cregan gives Stabler his gun and badge back, and says that he made the trouble with IAB over the shooting go away. Stabler realises that Cregan must have pulled some pretty big strings to make it happen so fast.Benson comes in and tells Stabler that they found ten other mothers involved in the smuggling ring, who Gerard probably would have killed. Stabler is clearly still distressed over the shooting, and Benson asks if he has spoken to a shrink about it yet. He says no, and asks whether it helped her to talk to a shrink after she shot a perp. She says it didn't help much."

Inside, the video store clerk shoots the masked gunman who first started firing, but not before he has shot a little girl, who is lying unconscious next to her hysterical older sister.Detective Deuthorn arrives on the scene, and CSU walks him through what happened. The ski-mask wearing gunman, Eric Campbell, appears to have attempted to rob the store at gunpoint, when the little girl, Rebecca Kurtz, dropped a video and startled him, making him fire in her direction, shooting her and the man standing outside, before he himself is shot dead by the store clerk, Joey Field. Deuthorn talks to Field, who is shaken up, but Deuthorn tells him he did a good job.Rebecca Kurtz has been taken to the hospital and is put on life support and it is discovered that she has gonorrhea, at which point detectives Benson and Stabler are called onto the case.Munch and Tutuola talk to Missy Kurtz, Rebecca's teenage sister who was with her in the store. She is crying and distraught, but manages to tell them that their father works from home and spends a lot of time with Rebecca. She tells them also that she was adopted by the Kurtzes when she was twelve, and that her biological father was extremely abusive.Stabler talks to Mrs. Kurtz who reveals that Rebecca has been declared brain dead, while Benson talks to Mr. Kurtz, telling him that Rebecca was abused and asking for a DNA sample. He refuses and reacts very angrily to her suggestion, but Benson's instincts tell her that he is innocent. Tutuola, however, reveals that several years ago Missy filed a complaint of abuse against her adoptive father.Tutuola and Munch speak to the ACS caseworker who handled Missy, and she tells them that Missy was simply confused about the difference between a 'good touch' and a 'bad touch', after being abused since age five by her biological father. After some counselling, she recanted.After clearing Rebecca's piano and ballet teachers, Benson and Stabler go to her school and find out that Rebecca had suffered some incontinence, but that, as she was only six years old, it didn't really raise any alarm bells. Meanwhile, the Kurtzes have made it known that they intend to pull the plug on Rebecca, so that they can donate her organs.The detectives insist that they need time for a specialist to examine Rebecca to get all their evidence, before she is allowed to die. Cabot takes the matter to court, asking for a restraining order against the parents until the test can be done. The Kurtzes argue that as more time passes, Rebecca's organs are degenerating, and there is a dying little boy in Philadelphia who urgently needs a liver, to whom Rebecca is a match. The judge, however, agrees to the restraining order.After the examination is completed, it is confirmed that Rebecca was raped. Cabot wakes up a judge for the restraining order to be lifted, and Rebecca is taken off life support in time for her liver to be donated to the boy in Philadelphia. The Kurtz family agree to tests for gonorrhoea, and Mr. Kurtz comes back clean, however this could be because he was recently treated.Benson and Stabler talk to the Kurtzes' doctor, who says that he never treated Mr. Kurtz for gonorrhoea, but that he did treat Missy. Benson and Stabler confront Missy at her house, and she accuses her boyfriend of raping her and Rebecca and threatening to kill her if she ever told anyone. She reveals that her boyfriend is Joey Field, the clerk at the video store, and that he made her take Rebecca to the store the day of the shooting. She says that Field and Campbell, the masked shooter, were friends.Tutuola and Munch go to Eric Campbell's house and speak briefly to his drunkard father, who lets them search Eric's room. He was a new stereo and other expensive equipment, including a new answering machine, which has a message from Joey Field saved on it. The message appears to involve an arranged meeting, but is not explicit enough to amount to any kind of evidence. However, a technician at the lab has examined the gunshot residue pattern on Rebecca's shirt and it reveals that Campbell moved closer to Rebecca in order to shoot her (presumably after his first shot missed and hit the man outside the store).Benson and Stabler go to Joey Field's house and lure him outside (so they can arrest him without a warrant) by saying he is going to win an award for his heroism at the video store. It turns out that Field's father is a high profile lawyer, who refuses to let his son cooperate with the police. At arraignment, it appears as though Field Snr. knows the judge very well, but this does him no favours as Joey is remanded without bail.Missy's lawyer appeals to Donnelly and Cabot for her to have immunity if she agrees to testify against Joey, so that she won't be prosecuted for taking her sister to the store. Donnelly agrees. Meanwhile, the detectives are having trouble finding any helpful witnesses from the video store, while Malcolm Field begins to swamp Cabot with useless motions (such as to exclude the answering machine as evidence), and calls Deuthorn to testify that Joey was a hero.Munch and Tutuola search the Fields' residence, and find a shocking tape. The detectives and Cabot view it and find that it is a video of Rebecca Kurtz, apparently drugged, and Joey Field and Missy Kurtz abusing her together. They realise that the abuse and the killing were all Missy's idea, but there's nothing they can do now that she has immunity from prosecution.Cabot and Cregan go to speak with Joey Field in prison, but he refuses to betray Missy. They reveal that his test for gonorrhoea was negative, meaning that Missy must be cheating on him, and got the disease from someone else, then gave it to Rebecca. Joey finally admits that everything was Missy's idea, and that she had planned the killing to look like a robbery gone wrong (Eric wasn't aware that as part of the plan, he too would be killed) and asked him to participate. He reveals that while Rebecca was usually drugged during the abuse, she had woken up one time and threatened to tell her parents, and that is why Missy decided to kill her.Cabot is determined to find a way to break Missy's immunity, studying through the case law. Donnelly tells her that DA Branch okayed the death penalty for Joey, and to give up, because there was no way to get Missy for the crime. Cabot does, however, come up with a plan, which involves Malcolm Field helping her, in exchange for Joey's death penalty coming off the table.Field argues, in front of Judge Petrovsky, that the ADA can't put Missy on the stand to testify against Joey, because they know that what she is saying is perjury, but by not putting Missy on the stand, Joey is denied his constitutional right to confront his accuser. Petrovsky agrees, and voids the immunity. Petrovsky knows that the whole thing was Cabot's idea, and is not happy with her. She tells Cabot that she had better have all the evidence ready to convict Missy by tomorrow.Missy is arrested, and the Kurtzes storm into the station, furious. The detectives show them the video, and although they are horrified, they intend to stand by Missy, because they don't want to lose another daughter. When the detectives ask where Missy could possibly have gotten the money to pay off Eric Campbell, they refuse to help.Missy refuses to cooperate with the detectives or Cabot, and her lawyer argues that with her childhood history, a jury will not convict her. Huang talks to Missy, and determines that she is a sociopath. She has no feelings for Rebecca or the Kurtzes, and feels no guilt. He says that by the time the Kurtzes adopted Missy, the damage was probably already done.Munch and Tutuola go over the things they found in Eric Campbell's room, and find a pawn ticket from a few days before the murder. The pawn shop owner shows them the gold locket which he sold, inscribed with the words 'To Missy, love Mum and Dad'.In a final meeting with Missy, she appears cocky, confident that she will not be convicted. Cabot sets her straight- they have the evidence, and she will be convicted and executed. Missy is cold and has no remorse. \"You can't kill me,\" she says. \"I'm already dead.\"Outside the courthouse, Mr. Kurtz pleads with Cabot to take away Missy's death penalty, which she cannot do."

      "corpus": "The episode begins with two men waiting on the platform of a subway station. One of the men is busy telling a story, but the other man is busy watching a girl in school uniform out of the corner of his eye. As the express train rushes past the station, she attempts to jump in front of it, and he pulls her back just in time.Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene as the girl is being put into an ambulance. She is 15 years old and looks very traumatised, and the paramedics say she was not wearing panties. She tells Elliot her name is Jackie Landricks. The detectives view security camera footage from the station and notice that a young man was following Jackie, but ran away when she tried to jump. They are able to discern the logo of a bike messenger service from his T-Shirt, and find that he was fired but the company gives them his name- Karl Serrit.Benson and Stabler go to see Jackie at the hospital. The doctor says that Jackie had been raped, and that she had restraint marks across her body where she had been tied down. Stabler talks to Tom Landricks, Jackie's father, about volunteering DNA samples from the men in the family and he does not object. Jackie says that someone grabbed her and put her in a van as she was walking home from school. She says she was blindfolded during the attack, but IDs Cark Serrit from a photo array, as she noticed him following her at the subway station. She adds that her rapist had a studded penis.Munch and Tutuola interview Karl, who has a record of violence against another woman. He denies ever knowing Jackie Landricks. Munch and Tutuola keep offering Karl sodas until he needs to use the bathroom. They accompany him and notice that he is studded like Jackie's attacker, and arrest him on this basis. Gina Bernardo, Karl's lawyer, storms in and takes away all the empty cans which Munch is trying to collect, so they cannot get Karl's DNA from them. She argues that they essentially tricked Karl into thinking he could not leave, and that she would stop them from compelling any DNA from him based on the fact that they saw his was studded.Meanwhile, Warner recalls that she has seen a similar pattern of restraints on a victim before. A body nicknamed \"Chelsea Doe\" was found dumped in the water with head and fingers chopped off, though she was probably strangled, and restraint patterns similar to Jackie's. She has also finished analysing Jackie's rape kit and found DNA from two separate men, one of whom takes medication for cholesterol and is therefore older than Karl. The DNA does not match Jackie's father.Benson and Stabler visit the Landricks house to speak to Jackie again and find that her mother, Angie, runs a day care centre in the home. They talk to Jackie up in her room, but she is not very helpful in explaining why she didn't notice that there were two perps, and cannot offer any additional clues. Stabler leaves the room and speaks to Jackie's six-year-old sister Sally, who is very affectionate and takes his pen 'as a gift for her'. She reveals that a man named James Randall lives in the room next to Jackie and Stabler finds his cholesterol medication. When he returns to Jackie's room to ask her about Randall, she becomes very defensive and storms out. They suspect that she knows it was Randall who raped her.Munch and Tutuola interrogate Randall and he denies having anything to do with Jackie, and is horrified when they show him pictures of Chelsea Doe. He agrees to give a DNA sample to clear himself. They cannot get a DNA sample from Karl, because Bernardo successfully argued that Munch and Tutuola coerced him to go to the toilet, and they wouldn't have cause to get DNA if it weren't for seeing the stud. Meanwhile, the doctor informs Benson that Jackie has cervical dysplasia, so despite her insistence that she has never had a boyfriend, she has apparently had quite a few. Benson and Stabler go to Jackie's school to talk to her teacher, who admits that she had concerns when she found out Jackie was dating an older boy. She reveals that Jackie was dating Karl Serrit. They go to speak to Jackie at her home again and she admits that Karl was her boyfriend but that she doesn't know who raped her and the only reason she pointed to Karl was because she wanted someone to blame. She becomes very hostile when the detectives begin to lose patience with her story and insinuate that she knows more than she is saying. They ask her father, Tom Landricks, why he rented a room to Randall next to his teenage daughter, and he admits he was stupid but they needed the money. Normally, he only rents the room to women.Angie Landricks comes in with a bunch of kids, including Sally, who drags Elliot away and gives him a present of a bracelet. Stabler talks to Huang about Sally's behaviour, saying she is a little too affectionate. Huang says it is possibly a sign of abuse, but Stabler says the kids seem happy at home, otherwise.The DNA kit from Jackie's rape gets a hit, a butcher named Eno who has a violent history. He denies ever touching Jackie, but says that he slept with Angie Landricks. The other DNA sample also finds a match- Randall. Randall seems shocked by the result, but says that he never touched Jackie, but he did sleep with Angie Landricks. He says that it was Tom Landricks' idea, and that he paid Randall.Huang analyses Tom Landricks and says that he is narcissistic and sex-obsessed. He treats the children like adults, and pimps out his wife and daughter to make up for the fact that he's probably impotent and/or infertile. Jackie won't speak against him, because she doesn't want to be accused as the one who broke up the family.They call in Child Services to take away the Landricks children as well as the children in Angie Landricks' day care. Benson and Stabler arrest Angie, who accuses Jackie of bringing this all upon them, and they are perplexed to find two little boys in the house who don't belong in the day care. Sally reveals that they are her brothers, although they clearly have another father.When interviewing Angie, she admits that the boys are hers and that Tom wanted her to have more children, although he himself couldn't father anymore after Sally. He brought random men in off the street to father the children. Angie herself is now unable to have anymore children, so therefore it is Jackie's turn to supply the babies. Benson and Stabler decide to talk to Jackie again, but find that she has been moved to a specialist centre because she has had some sort of breakdown. In the hallway, they run into Tom Landricks and he and Elliot nearly come to blows. Huang tells them that Jackie has regressed to a childlike state of mind, due to the trauma. Stabler suggests that she could easily be faking it, and Huang suggests that he talk to her, since he is the father figure that she is now looking to replace. He goes into the room where Jackie is and they sort of play with a doll and a teddy bear, while Stabler tries to get Jackie to admit what's really going on in her family. She finally admits that her father tied her down and inseminated her (with Randall and Eno's sperm, from their liaison with Angie Landricks).Tom Landricks' lawyer wants a deal- he will plead guilty on promoting prostitution, a misdemeanour. She threatens to slam Jackie's testimony in court as that of a troubled, promiscuous girl. Cabot refuses the deal absolutely.In court, Jackie falters when testifying against her father. She cannot bring herself to do it and instead accuses Stabler of confusing her and making her lie, and says that her parents would never hurt her. Without Jackie's testimony, there is no case, meaning the children will go home to Tom and Angie. They find out that Jackie is pregnant and intends to keep the baby. While puzzling the connection of Chelsea Doe's murder to the present case, they suggest that Landricks may have murdered her.Huang goes to the ME's office to inspect Chelsea Doe's body, and says that it is very possible that Tom Landricks has the mentality to kill. He suggests that the head and fingers were probably kept as souvenirs, and restrained her in such a way that she would fight back. The detectives find that a woman named Karen once lived at the Landricks address but went missing around the time Chelsea Doe's body was found, and go to speak to her grandmother. The grandmother says that Karen was the Landricks' nanny, but that she moved to Europe 2 years ago and has not contacted her since. She reveals that it was Tom Landricks who told her that Karen moved away, and Stabler finds a photograph of Karen wearing the bracelet which Sally had given him.Benson and Stabler go to talk to Sally, who is still at the ACS home, and Sally says that she took the bracelet from Jackie's drawer. Jackie admits that she found the bracelet in Karen's room after she 'left'. They decide to pull up the floor in what was Karen's room, and find her head and fingers.They go to speak to Tom Landricks in jail, and he suggests that the police set him up. The DNA from the remains found in the house match Karen's grandmother, and therefore it is probably Karen. Tom admits that he had to kill Karen to protect his family, because she threatened to tell the police about what he was doing.At the ACS home, Stabler goes to talk to Jackie, who is doing better and is no longer trapped under her father's spell. She tells him she no longer intends to keep the baby, as that is what her father would've wanted, and she doesn't want to do that anymore."

      "corpus": "Narcotics police burst into an apartment, planning to make a drug bust but instead find the female occupant stabbed to death, with signs of sexual assault. The drug squad want to take credit for finding the woman's drug crop, so one of the officers calls a buddy of his at SVU, who happens to be Tutuola. Fin takes over the case for SVU, but lets the Narcotics police take credit for seizing the woman's marijuana crop.The victim, Susan O'Striker, has been hit in the head with the telephone, raped and then stabbed many times to death with a knife from her own kitchen. The pattern of the killer, running back and forth throughout the apartment reveals that he is lacking some logic, and may be on drugs or mentally disturbed. The body has been covered after the woman was murdered, and someone has thrown up- possibly the killer, feeling remorse.Benson and Stabler speak to O'Striker's neighbour who tipped off the narcotics police about her activities, although she never actually saw O'Striker dealing drugs. The M.E. is able to determine that there is no sperm in the rape kit, and that the killer may have some sort of medical problem. She also reveals that the victim had advanced ovarian cancer and probably would have only lived another year. Munch suggests that she may have been growing the drugs to use for medicinal purposes, and that she might have a 'club' with other sufferers who share the drugs.They find one of O'Striker's notebooks, with a hundred people listed, but only by their initials. Matching these against her phone records, they are able to find other members of the 'club'. Benson and Stabler interview one woman suffering from Multiple Sclerosis who says that most of the club members are too weak to attack anyone, but mentions the violent husband of one woman who used to share the drugs. Munch and Tutuola speak to this man, but find that his alibi holds up for the time of the killing.Warner analyses the contents of the vomit found at the scene, and determines that it is the contents of a school lunch which is served at middle schools across the city. They realise that the killer they are looking for is a child (no sperm because he's not fully mature, and an immature thought process). Huang is not able to offer a helpful profile, but they suspect that the killer would want to stay within their comfort zone. Benson and Stabler decide to interview the son of the neighbour who tipped off the drug squad, and find out that he was given a brand new Mp3 player by another boy at school. Mark admits that he told this boy, Jeremy Brice, that he had a drug dealer living next door.Benson and Stabler pick up Jeremy while he is waiting for the bus, and find that he has blood on his jacket. He was not in school at the time of the murder and his prints are in the apartment. Munch and Tutuola go to Jeremy's school and find out that although he has trouble fitting in, there has never been any serious trouble with him. Believing that Jeremy might have an accomplice, they ask for a list of all the boys absent from school at the time of the murder, and search their lockers. In the locker of Zachary Connors they find the knife that killed Susan O'Striker, as well as her wallet.There are three sets of fingerprints on the knife. The detectives look find out that Zachary is a straight-A student who has never been in any trouble. When they interview him with his parents, he seems to have an answer for everything. He says he wasn't absent from school, but that he was in the library studying for a test, and that he is not really friends with Jeremy. He says that he found the knife and wallet in a dumpster, that Jeremy told him to look there, and that he had intended to hand them both in. Jeremy is more loyal to Zachary, and refuses to say anything that might implicate him. That is, until the detectives show him a video of Zachary's statement that implicates Jeremy. Jeremy admits that it was his idea to break into the apartment, so people would think he was cool, but that Zachary attacked Susan O'Striker.As Zachary is 12 years old, he will be charged in the children's court. Jeremy is 14, however, so it is up to Cabot to decide where he should be tried. She wants to send him to family court, but the DA overrules her and wants Jeremy tried for murder as an adult. Cabot argues with Liz Donnelly over this, claiming that Jeremy doesn't deserve the sentence he might receive if charged as an adult. Donnelly disagrees, saying that Jeremy had an opportunity to leave the apartment, to get help, etc., but instead decided to hand Zach the knife he used to kill Susan O'Striker. She decides that, since Cabot objects so much to trying Jeremy as an adult, she will take the case and Cabot will be her second chair.Outside the court, Cabot and Donnelly run into Jeremy's lawyer, Gina Bernardo, who hands them a motion of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect- due to Jeremy's 14 year old brain. Bernardo is able to present scientific studies which show that despite the law ruling that Jeremy is old enough to be tried as an adult, the adolescent brain is actually not capable of distinguishing things the way and adult brain does. The judge allows the defence.A scientist testifies at the trial about a study which mapped the brains of a group of teenagers. The study determined that teenagers are 'wired' so that they have erratic thought processes and are prone to impulsive behaviour that they cannot adequately control. On cross, Donnelly questions the credibility of the evidence by getting the scientist to admit that the study only really shows that teenagers are 'prone' to such behaviour, and there is no guarantee, nor does the study seek to prove which teenager will behave criminally and which will not.Jeremy takes the stand and Bernardo asks him about his concept of right and wrong. His testimony is confused and he doesn't seem to know whether it is worse to lie about a terrible act being committed or to betray a friend. On cross examination, Donnelly accuses him of knowing exactly what Zachary intended to use the knife for, and of not doing anything to prevent it. Jeremy breaks down and cries.Donnelly is upset after having to make Jeremy breakdown on the stand. She tells Cabot that she wants her to call Zach to the stand, as now that his own case in family court is over with, he can be called as a witness. She also requests that Cabot be the one to examine him. When Zach testifies, he insists that Jeremy was the one who attacked and killed Susan O'Striker but is adamant that he was not at all scared at any point. Cabot plays on his arrogance and makes him admit that he was not afraid, it was Jeremy who was afraid and Jeremy who threw up, thereby implicating himself instead.Donnelly and Cabot offer Jeremy a deal, 5-10 years minimum, a very generous offer considering that he might get 25 to life if the jury finds him guilty. Jeremy's mother is adamant, however, that Zachary's testimony and apparent confession cleared her son in the jury's eyes and that he will be found innocent. She refuses the deal.The jury makes a finding of guilty. Bernardo polls the jury and finds that most of them believed that Jeremy was guilty. Vessa289"

      "corpus": "Benson and Stabler are called to a hospital where a rape victim has been reported. After looking for her initially in the emergency room, they find out that the victim, Stephanie Rawley, is actually a coma patient in the intensive care ward. Stephanie had gone into a coma after a car accident a year ago, and had recently been transferred to the hospital from a rehab centre. The doctor at the hospital ordered some tests, and found that she was pregnant, and called SVU.When Stephanie's parents are informed, they immediately suspect her fiancée David Anderson, against whom they have a restraining order because he 'tried to kill her'. When Munch and Tutuola go to speak with David, he explains that Stephanie's wishes were that she not be kept alive artificially, but her parents don't understand. He insists that he has kept away from the hospital since the restraining order was put in place. He reveals that the car crash Stephanie was in was his fault, because she got hit by a truck while going to pick him up from his bucks party.While not counting out David as a suspect, the detectives believe it is more likely that a staff member at the rehab centre raped Stephanie. They ask Cabot what they could do to secure DNA from every member of the staff, and she says that it isn't possible unless everyone consents. Cregan tells them they should try to get voluntary DNA samples from everyone they can now, and test whichever ones they feel necessary later.Benson and Stabler interview Dr. Mandell, whom they find alone in a room with another coma patient, and find that he is willing to give a DNA test. Munch and Tutuola talk to Clark Jensen, a physiotherapist, who is also willing to volunteer his DNA. Jensen admits to them that he has seen David Anderson at the hospital late at night, in Stephanie's bed.Munch and Tutuola go back to talk to David, and he admits that the night nurse feels sorry for him and lets him in to see Stephanie, and that he holds her because he believes it calms her down. He is also willing to volunteer his DNA.Mrs. Rawley, Stephanie's mother, calls Benson and is frantic when she finds out that Stephanie has suddenly been transferred back to the rehab centre without her knowledge. Benson and Stabler go to the centre and find Stephanie is about to undergo an abortion, performed by a Dr. Garrison, which they manage to stop in time. They talk to Dr. Mandell, who authorised the procedure, who says that the pregnancy puts Stephanie's life in danger. He reveals that he had Stephanie's father's consent to perform the procedure.Mr. and Mrs. Rawley fight over Stephanie's pregnancy- Mrs. Rawley, a strict Catholic, wants to keep it, but Mr. Rawley has less affectionate views towards the baby. Stabler questions Mr. Rawley about the lunch breaks he spends by Stephanie's bedside, alone, and Rawley loses his temper and hits him. Stabler refuses to arrest Rawley for hitting him, thinking he would have reacted the same way.Back at the station, they debate whether Mr. Rawley's reaction was too strong, and why Mrs. Rawley would want to keep the baby. Olivia's situation (of her mother choosing to keep her after she was raped) is brought up. Until the baby is born, they have no DNA for a paternity test, so in the meantime, they decide to question the only two men at the rehab centre who refused to give their DNA. One of these men is a conspiracy theorist who doesn't want to be framed; the other is a hypochondriac who doesn't want to know if he has any diseases once his DNA is tested. The hypochondriac suggests that Benson and Stabler talk to an employee from a funeral home, who goes to the centre to pick up bodies and occasionally loiters around the coma wing.Benson and Stabler talk to the funeral home employee, Wesley Dilbert, about why he roams the hospital (he says to get snacks from vending machines), and then question him about a dropped assault accusation against him made by a prostitute named Maxine. Wesley denies he did anything to Maxine, and accuses her of stealing his wallet.The detectives speak with Maxine, who says she only stole Wesley's wallet so she would know his name to report him, but dropped the charges because the police didn't take her seriously because she was a prostitute. She tells them that Wesley had trouble performing, and wanted her to lie in a bath filled with ice to bring her body temperature down.Benson and Stabler go to talk to Wesley again, and he denies everything. They find out that he has only been working at that funeral home a couple of months, and Munch and Tutuola talk to his previous employer. The employer tells them that Wesley was caught on security video having relations with a deceased woman.Benson and Stabler interrogate Wesley, and show him video of the incident at the funeral home. He becomes very nervous, but Huang pulls Benson out of the room, telling her that Wesley's problem is that he is terrified of women. Stabler tries empathising with him, but Wesley refuses to admit he ever went into Stephanie Rawley's room. The detectives think he is lying, but Huang says it is possible that he can't bring himself to perform with living women. Cabot has him charged with necrophilia to get him off the street, but the judge grants him bail.Huang suggests that in order to speed up the case, they might try to get DNA from Stephanie's baby without harming the foetus, using a new experimental procedure he knows about. The blood type does not match Wesley or Stephanie's fiancée, but it does match Dr. Mandell. They interrogate him, and he denies raping Stephanie, but Huang brings in a picture of the uterus of another female coma patient in Mandell's care, and the picture shows signs of scarring from a recent abortion.They find out that the second coma patient's abortion was performed by Dr. Garrison, the same woman who tried to abort Stephanie's foetus. She and Dr. Mandell work together at a research lab that specialises in research into Parkinson's disease. Garrison reveals that, due to government banning of stem cell research, they were forced to get private financing for their research. A wealthy man suffering Parkinson's disease, Davis Langley, paid them to produce stem cells which would match him by inseminating Stephanie Rawley.Mandell says that his insemination of Stephanie was legal, because her parents signed a blanket consent form covering experimental procedures. Their intention was to abort the pregnancy and inject stem cell's into Davis Langley's brain. Mandell reveals that he is motivated by watching his own father die of Parkinson's.Stabler and Cabot try to speak to Langley, but his lawyer does not allow it. He tells them that Langley was unaware of the research, and didn't know what the samples he gave were being used for. Cabot is able to get an indictment for Mandell and Garrison, but not Langley. She reveals that there is a loophole in the law which means that it is hard to convict someone for stealing human eggs. Huang advises her to appeal to the jury, who all have mothers, daughters, etc., who Stephanie Rawley might remind them of.During the trial, Mrs. Rawley tells the jury about Stephanie's condition and how she visits her everyday, firm in the belief that Stephanie is still alive in there and may wake up one day. The defence lawyer, Trevor Langan, suggests that Stephanie was such a nice person, she would've wanted to help people with Parkinson's like this, but Mrs. Rawley disputes, saying Stephanie never would have agreed to an abortion.Mandell takes the stand and talks about stem cell research and its potential for curing disease. Cabot worries that the defence's case might be winning over the jury, who all know someone who has suffered with a disease that stem cells might be able to cure.Langley surprisingly decides to testify on behalf of the defence, and tells the jury about his terrible experiences suffering with Parkinson's. He admits that the insemination of coma patients was his idea, because he believed that Stephanie was probably dead (her body just kept alive on machines), and he would rather use her than ask a woman to get pregnant just to have an abortion. He says that he is not worried about going to jail, because it is nothing compared to what he has suffered.The jury is won over by the defence, and only finds Mandell and Garrison guilty on battery- a slap on the wrist. Mrs. Rawley comes in to the station, frantic again, because Langley has petitioned for custody of Stephanie's baby once it is born, claiming it because he is the father. They realise that the only reason he wants the baby is for the umbilical cord, which holds stem cells which would be a match to him."

      "corpus": "An airport bus arrives at Kennedy Airport with an unexpected passenger: a young boy in the luggage compartment, dead of carbon monoxide asphyxiation.  He has a large cut on one arm, and has also been beaten and sexually abused. Although the airport is in Queens, the bus began its journey in Manhattan and made no stops along the way. The Queens SVU detective gladly turns the case over to Elliot Stabler.Elliot and Olivia visit the maintenance yard, where the bus began its journey. They find a torn piece of a shirt snagged on a hole in the yard's chain-link fence, and a teddy bear under the wheel of the bus. The bear looks new, and has blood and broken glass on it. A security video from the previous night shows two boys, one older than the other, slipping through the hole in the fence. The older boy's shirt snags on the fence and tears. The younger boy, who's holding the teddy bear, appears to be willingly accompanying the older boy.The blood on the bear matches the victim's. Broken glass similar to that on the bear, is also in the cut on the dead boy's arm. The glass is tempered safety glass, the kind used for soundproofing. The victim is not a street kid. He's clean, well-nourished and healthy, and has $10,000 worth of dental work performed within the last month. He has a custom-made dental implant which can be traced to the manufacturer, and to the dentist who ordered it. A rape kit tested positive for semen, and recently healed suture scars are on the boy's anus.The older boy, Ernesto Diaz, is later found at the Port Authority terminal. He is devastated to learn that the younger boy, his friend Jose, is dead. Both of them are from Guatemala. Ernesto came to New York by boat two years ago, to go to school. Instead, the charity who brought him to the States gave him to a man named Bret Jansen. Jose arrived only the previous month, Jansen having said that Ernesto was becoming too old to please him. Jansen kept both boys locked up, forced them to have sex with him, and beat them when they refused.No U.S. government agency has any record of Ernesto or Jose, so the boys were smuggled into the States. Jansen is a partner at a Wall Street law firm, but at the moment he's missing in action. SVU obtains a search warrant for his loft. The heavy-duty soundproofed door has multiple deadbolt locks, all unlocked. Inside, the detectives find a super-secured home environment and the broken window Ernesto and Jose had escaped through.  In the bedroom is the mutilated, bloody body of Bret Jansen. His throat was cut, and his genitals were cut off.Cragen wonders if Ernesto killed Jansen, to stop the abuse. Elliot and Olivia doubt it. Jansen's bedroom had been a bloodbath, and Ernesto hadn't had a drop on him. CSU found fresh traces of blood in Jansen's shower, indicating that the killer had tried to clean up after himself. An adult might think of that, but a teenager wouldn't.Ernesto tells Olivia that Jansen had passed him around to other men, who would return him afterward. Jansen had threatened to do the same with Jose. Rather than see that happen, Ernesto helped Jose escape. Huang says the brutality of Jansen's murder suggests jealousy, therefore a personal connection.  Elliot agrees; Jansen's loft was so secure, he had to have known his killer.A search of Jansen's loft turns up a repugnant videotape of Jansen with a third boy. Another man with  tattoos on his back and his forearm is also in the video, but his face is never shown.  The search also finds phony adoption papers for Ernesto and Jose, and literature from the North American Man-Boy Love Association. Jansen was one utterly worthless human being, so much so that Elliot comments, \"Let's face it. Killing Jansen was a public service.\"Jose's dental implant is traced to dentist Walt Massey. He tells Munch and Fin that he didn't know Jansen well, but he admired Jansen for adopting two boys from a foreign country. Jansen wanted only the best for his sons. Asked if Jansen had referred any other patients recently, Massey replies no.Elliot and Olivia visit Jansen's law firm and talk with his secretary. She tells them that Jansen had neither family nor children. His desk calendar shows a recent lunch date with his client Stewart Lynch, at the Metropolis Club.Lynch, a plastic surgeon, tells Elliot and Olivia that Jansen had been a real ladies' man. The only children they ever discussed were Lynch's. Because Jansen had a terrible temper, Lynch thinks Jansen would have made a lousy father and that kids would have driven him crazy. Jansen had also been friends with club member Tony Damon, with whom he'd played squash. The night of Jansen's murder, Lynch was in the operating room all night trying to repair an auto accident victim's mangled hand.Damon had just returned from a business trip the night of Jansen's murder. He travels a great deal for work, so he spends any downtime he has relaxing at home. He says that Jansen, the better squash player, had a strange sense of humor. During one game, Damon served an ace which Jansen laughed off as a lucky shot. Jansen said Damon usually played like a woman, and that he should have cut Damon's balls off long ago.Warner tells Elliot and Olivia that Jansen's genitals \"weren't exactly cut off.\" They had been surgically removed with a scalpel by someone who knows anatomy, and pre-mortem. The killer had also precisely cut the carotid arteries on either side of Jansen's neck. Lynch, the plastic surgeon, certainly could have killed Jansen and sewn up Jose.Elliot and Olivia ask Ernesto if Jansen had ever taken him and Jose to a doctor. Ernesto replies that the doctor would come to see them at home when they were sick. Shown several pictures one at a time, Ernesto identifies Lynch as their doctor.Background checks reveal that Lynch has three adopted sons. Damon owns a travel agency called Global Voyages. Cell phone records reveal that the night Jansen was murdered, he made separate calls to Lynch and Damon. Then Damon called Lynch back. U.S. Customs records show that Jansen traveled to Guatemala two years ago, about the same time that Ernesto came to New York. Damon is setting up his friends on sex tours, from which they bring back human souvenirs. The friends then pass the boys around among themselves. SVU is dealing with a ring of pedophiles, not just one offender.Realizing that Lynch must also be part of the ring, SVU seeks to remove his sons immediately from his custody. Alex Cabot tells Elliot and Olivia that neither the phone calls nor Lynch's ethical failure to report Jose's abuse, are sufficient evidence to justify removal. Olivia then shows Alex an old e-mail from Damon, found on Jansen's computer: \"Your special tour to Central America is confirmed. If your friends enjoy, have them get in touch.\" Damon is soliciting men to travel overseas and rape children, which is a federal crime. Alex tells the detectives to catch Damon in the act.Under another name, Munch contacts Damon by e-mail. After checking \"John Blackmun's\" credit to verify his identity, Damon invites Munch to visit him at his travel agency. Munch says and does all the right things, including paying in cash. Eventually Damon takes the bait and offers to arrange a sex tour, complete with souvenir videotape. Munch then reveals his real identity and arrests Damon. Fin and several other officers enter the office and seize the agency's files and computers.Initially, Damon blows off SVU. New York has no state law against sex tours, and federal law requires a complaining victim which SVU doesn't have. Quickly enough he changes his tune when he realizes he's the best suspect they have for Jansen's murder, especially since Jansen had said he \"should have cut off [Damon's] balls long ago.\" Damon says he told Lynch about that joke. While Damon had arranged the sex tours, Jansen and Lynch had obtained their \"sons\" themselves. During his own trip to Guatemala, Lynch had hand-picked Jose for Jansen. The night Jansen was murdered, he called Lynch after discovering Ernesto and Jose's escape. Lynch had called Damon to ask about the souvenir videotape of his tour; Damon had told him it was on the way.  Damon begs for a deal, in exchange for his delivering Lynch to them.The sex tours are a federal matter, so Alex can't make a deal with Damon there. She won't grant him immunity until she's sure he didn't kill Jansen. Cragen suggests that perhaps they can nail Lynch without Damon's help, since Lynch's sex tour videotape is in the mail.The package containing Lynch's videotape arrives. The mail carrier has barely departed when Lynch comes out and scoops it off the front step.  SVU raids his house, catches him eagerly watching the tape, and arrests him.Lynch insists he legally adopted his boys. Alex replies that the adoption papers are phony. The police have located the INS agent Lynch and Jansen paid to obtain their boys' visas. Lynch is facing some serious federal charges. Told that his hospital said he was on vacation the night of Jansen's murder, Lynch clarifies that the surgery he performed that night was at a different hospital 350 miles away. To curry favor with the U.S. Attorney, Lynch gives Alex the names of all the pedophile ring members he knows.SVU picks up 17 other members of the ring. Lynch's out-of-town alibi is confirmed, leaving Jansen's murder still unsolved. The doctor's report on Lynch's sons says that they have perfect teeth. Elliot then remembers the dentist, Walt Massey. He wasn't one of Damon's sex tour clients, nor is he a member of the Metropolis Club. He is married, with two young sons. The pedophile ring had its own doctor, Lynch. Logically it would have its own dentist, too.SVU obtains a search warrant for Massey's home. Walt isn't there, but his wife is. Olivia sees a picture of the sons, and comments on their lack of resemblance to Walt.  Mrs. Massey, a kind and sensitive woman, explains that the boys are her children from a previous marriage. Their father is in prison for trying to kill her, and he's lost his parental rights. She met Walt when he answered a personal ad she put in the newspaper, and he adopted the boys after marrying her.Under gentle questioning from Olivia, Mrs. Massey admits that her husband spends a lot of time alone with the older son, Shawn. It's painfully apparent that Mrs. Massey knows there may be something about Walt. However, she met him at an extremely vulnerable time in her life. Walt had saved her and her sons from a homeless shelter and given them a real home, free of physical abuse.Back at the squad room, Elliot gently questions Shawn one-on-one. Shawn eventually all but admits that his stepfather had sex with him. Even though she saw it coming, Mrs. Massey is still  devastated to hear Shawn reveal the truth.Walt Massey is brought in. Under skillful maneuvering from Elliot, Massey eventually trusts him enough to say, \"[Jansen's], uh…his punishment was especially appropriate, don't you think?\" Elliot then grabs Massey and reveals the tattoo on the dentist's forearm. Massey is the second, unseen man in Jansen's sex tour videotape. When Elliot tells him they found broken window glass from Jansen's loft in his sneaker, Massey admits to killing Jansen. Massey had seen the bruises on Jose's body when the boy was his patient. Jansen's abusiveness put the whole pedophile ring at risk, so Massey killed him to make sure he never hurt another boy again.However, Massey is completely oblivious to the idea that a man having sex with a boy is wrong. As Elliot literally backs him into a corner of the room, a cowering, pitiful Massey argues that he's different from Jansen:  \"I never forced Shawn. I never beat him like Jansen beat his boys.  It's not the same thing!\"  A totally disgusted Elliot replies, \"It's worse. You had sex with your stepson and you don't think there's anything wrong with that. What kind of sick bastard are you?\""

      "corpus": "A woman is found raped and murdered in Central Park by a dog walker. The Medical Examiner concludes the victim was stabbed to death and sexually assaulted. The detectives have a hard time identifying the victim or finding any suspects. The woman's dog is found a while later, the dog had one of her shoes with it and due to an orthopedic heel in it they are able to fin out the victim's identity, she was a public health doctor named Greta Esterman. Olivia and Elliot talk to her husband, he tells the detectives her work involved tracking sexual partners of patients recently diagnosed with HIV to have them checked as well. Mr. Esterman says his wife occasionally received hate mail and threatening calls, but never paid any attention to it. The detectives go through Greta's log of all the threatening calls and find one threat that matches the crime, it is from Roger Pomerantz. When Elliot and Olivia go to talk to Roger, he tries to flee, so he is arrested on violation of his parole. He is interviewed but has an alibi, so he is released; at that time, Mr. Esterman is arriving at the station to deliver some of Greta's work documents that might help in the investigation, they both cross paths and Mr. Esterman believing Roger is his wife's killer, looses control and punch him. Dr. Warner analyzes Greta's papers and comes to the conclusion she was trying to identify the common source of the HIV from some her patients, she believed they all had the same source. The detectives think that maybe Greta was close to finding the person that was spreading the HIV, so that person killed her. They follow the list of people she tracked and interview people trying to establish who gave it to whom, trying to find the source, they believe it is Mario Molinari, since he can be connected directly or indirectly to all the infected people. Elliot and Olivia find Mario at a hospital and confront him about Dr. Esterman's death, it turns out he was in the hospital at the time, but Elliot arrests Mario for knowingly giving HIV to people, since he knew about his condition and still had unprotected sex without telling his partners about his HIV. Meanwhile another body is found in the park, leading the detectives to think there is a serial killer on the loose, but the ME thinks maybe it is a copycat, since the injuries sustained by the second victim are not as many and not as and as the first victim. The forensics analyst disagrees; he found exactly the same evidence in both crime scenes, the same footprints and the same knife type. He also says that both types of soils are unique to that place, so of they catch a suspect, they can analyze his shoes, and match it to them giving no doubt about who killed those women. Olivia and Elliot try to find a connection between the victims, so they talk to Greta's friend. She tells about Greta's marriage to Arthur, how her family was against it because she was rich and he wasn't, and how Greta was the one who supported the couple. Elliot asks if any of them could've had any affair, and she reveals Greta asked her to check a man's credit report, the man's mane was Vartan Dadian. The detectives investigate this Vartan guy and find out he had an account and received a steady amount of money from Greta's account every month, they also find charges to an escort service in Vartan's name. Munch and Fin go to the Escort agency and get the name of the lady that serves Vartan regularly, Miss Kitty. Elliot and Olivia talk to Vartan Dadian about it, but he denies having an account in the bank in question, and claims he never met Greta or Miss Kitty. The detectives realize someone was using Mr. Dadian's identity to open the account and hire escorts, probably to hide from somebody. Munch and Fin interview Miss Kitty at the precinct and she recognizes Mr. Esterman's picture as being Vartan Dadian. The detective get a search warrant for Mr. Esterman's home, trying to fin some solid evidence that can prove he murdered his wife when she found out about his affair and decided to divorce him, because if she divorced him he would be left with nothing. Munch finds a dirty pair of shoes in Arthur's bedroom that matches the shoe-prints found in the crime scene, the lab matches the dirt from the crime scenes and the dirt on the shoes. Mr. Esterman denies any involvement in the murders and claims he was in the park after the murders, to lay flowers there. He argues that he took an alias to meet with escort girls to protect his wife; when asked for a DNA sample, he replies his DNA is expected to be found in his wife, but Elliot reveals they are going to match his DNA against a hair found in the other victim's body. The judge denies the warrant for Mr. Esterman's DNA, but Elliot finds out he already gave a DNA sample; in a fund-raising charity event, he donated blood, so they ask the judge to use that blood to compare to the sample in the victims body. They argue that he waved any right to privacy when he donated the blood, since it would be tested anyway in a hospital. The judge hears both sides and agrees to let the State test the blood, but only the same tests that would be done in the hospital to which he donated the blood. The test comes back and they find a high amount of Viagra and ecstasy, so they talk to Arthur's drug dealer, he gives up the address to where he delivers the drugs.Munch and Fin go there with a search warrant and catch him in bed with Miss Kitty; there they find a one-way ticket to Brazil and Kitty gets furious when she realizes he was planning to go alone. Kitty gives the detectives a sample of Mr. Esterman's DNA and they match it to the hair from the second crime scene. Arthur Esterman admits killing his wife and the other woman to divert the detectives, he claims she drove him to it, when she lost her sexual appetite; he tried to make her try the ecstasy, but she refused so he started seeing prostitutes, she found out and was going to divorce him leaving him with no money for his ecstasy or the prostitutes, so he had to kill her."

      "corpus": "A couple is woken up by a noise in their apartment and they find an old lady in the kitchen. The woman claims it is her house, so the couple calls the police. Olivia talks to the old woman, but it seems like she is senile or has some sort of dementia, upon a closer look, Olivia finds cigarette burn marks on her. She is taken to a hospital and examined, but there is no DNA present, the doctors tell Elliot and Olivia that the woman probably has alzheimer's. At the precinct, Elliot and Olivia try to get information out of the old lady, but she is too vague about everything. The detectives decide to start by investigating the address where she broke in, thinking the she must've lived there some time in her life. They track down one of the previous tenants and ask her about the lady. She recognizes the woman and says she was their neighbor when they were kids, her name is Bess Sherman; she also says they suspected Bess was abused by her uncle at the time. Dr. Huang says the latest attack triggers memories of the abuse she suffered when little, so she fled to the only place she felt safe, her friend's house. Knowing her name the police manage to find a nursing home where Bess used to live, there they inform the detectives that Bess's son, Joe Sherman. With a warrant in hands, Elliot and Olivia go to Joe's house. The supper says that since Joe brought Bess home, the collectors stopped showing up and the delivery companies started coming. At the apartment, Olivia finds Bess's bedroom and straps to keep her locked in the room. Joe claims the bills from the nursing home were too expensive, so he took her home, and the straps were for her own protection.In Joe's trash, Fin and Munch find a lot of cigarette buds, and some fingerprints in them. Bess's finances show large amounts o money to someone, they assume it is for Joe, but he claims it must've been for his son, Andy.  Andy admits he asked for the money, but only because the college fund that Bess had set up for him was used by Joe years ago. Andy denies hurting Bess, but says he was there with a friend, even though he doesn't believe his friend would do anything to Bess either, as he works at the nursing home. At the Jubilee Towers Nursing Home, Elliot and Olivia talk to Hal Shipley, but he denies it all. The manager says they had only one complaint about him, but it was from an alzheimer's patient, so they believed it wasn't true. Munch and Fin talk to the nursing patients, and many say they were harassed by Hal, but nobody believed them because they are senile or were under the effects of some medication at the time. Alex finds records of a suit against Jubilee Towers that was settled with a confidentiality clause. They decide to exhume the patient's body to see if there was any fowl play in it, and Melinda finds a needle prick that was unaccounted for in the medical records. She says that because of the embalming process is impossible to examine her for poisons, but it is possible that the needle prick is related to her death. Olivia and Elliot talk about the suit with Hope Garrett, the Nursing Home's manager and she says they settled it out of the court, because it was easier, and that many grieving families need to blame someone for their relative's death so they sue, but there was no fowl play from their part. They ask to speak with the staff about Hal. All of a sudden, there is a code blue in Bess's room and the detectives rush there. Hope is there, panicking she accuses Hal of doing it because she had just fired him. The doctors take Bess to another room and Olivia sees a fresh needle mark in Bess's arm. Elliot and Olivia go after Hal and ask him of his whereabouts for the last 15 minutes, but he refuses to cooperate.At the station, Capt. Craigen gives Hal the news, his fingerprint was found in one of the cigarette buds in Joe's trash, the Captain lies to Hal that in the other end of the bud was Bess's seared flesh, so they can prove he was the one that assaulted her that night. He confesses to burning her with the cigarette, but swears that he didn't go near Bess the day she coded, he proves by confessing he was hacking the Nursing Home's computer to steal drugs at the time. Munch and Fin check the computer and confirm Hal's story. Elliot and Olivia come to the conclusion that if Hal is telling the truth, the only other person that could've done it was Hope. They talk to the nurses and they say Mrs. Garrett saved people that were coding before. The detectives suspect she creates a crisis so she can save the day and receive all the attention. Elliot finds out that Hope Garrett was a nurse and had her license suspended. Olivia and Elliot arrest Hope at the Nursing Home."

      "corpus": "Benson and Stabler are at an elementary school, interviewing a six-year-old girl named Chloe, who has drawn a picture of her family that shows her crying. Benson asks her why she is crying and she says it is because her mother loves her 16yr old half-brother Kyle more than her, and that she once caught them in bed together. The teacher warns Stabler that Chloe's father, Lawrence Fuller, is a wealthy business man and has a temper, and that Chloe's mother, Gloria Stanfield, is a minor actress, and that they are both a handful.At the hospital, the doctors say that Chloe's injuries which had first gotten the teacher worried are just the usually scrapes and bruises a child gets, and when her father comes to pick her up he says that old fractures the doctors found are from when she fell when she was three. Benson and Stabler ask him whether he has noticed anything strange about his wife's relationship with his son, and he says no, but storms off and takes Chloe home.Munch and Tutuola go to speak to Kyle at his school, and he denies any inappropriate relationship with his stepmother, but the detectives aren't convinced. The Fuller's housekeeper reluctantly admits that she once caught Gloria kissing Kyle inappropriately. When Benson and Stabler are summoned to Gloria's lawyer's office to meet her, she denies any relationship with Kyle.Later, the detectives are called to a disturbance at Chloe's school and find Gloria and Lawrence arguing. Lawrence accuses Gloria of molesting his children, Gloria accuses him of being violent with them. Benson takes Chloe away and Stabler informs her parents that the kids will be placed in care until the matter is resolved. When Munch and Tutuola go to Kyle's school to pick him up, they find he is already gone. They talk to some of his friends who reveal that Gloria likes to flirt with them and that they wouldn't necessarily be surprised to find out that Kyle was sleeping with her.The detectives get a call that evening and find out that Lawrence Fuller has been murdered in his apartment, bashed with a baseball bat found underneath Kyle's bed. Gloria and Kyle are both missing, but Kyle soon shows up at the building and claims that he just went for a walk and knows nothing about the murder or where Gloria is.Gloria shows up at the station with a lawyer for Kyle, and talks to Benson and Stabler. She says that Lawrence and Kyle were fighting and she couldn't take it, so she left and went to a hotel, but she stops short of implicating Kyle. She says that she has no motive for murder herself, because she signed a prenuptial agreement which means she gets nothing, and all the money goes into trusts for Kyle and Chloe. When Kyle's prints are the only one's found on the murder weapon, he is arrested and charged, but he is released on bail. The detectives get a warrant for Gloria's hotel room, hoping to find the clothes Kyle was wearing when he killed his father. The clerk at the hotel tells them that Gloria left for the airport with a young man that sounds like Kyle, and by the time the detectives find out that they took a flight to Washington D.C., they have already returned.They go to the hotel room and find Kyle and Gloria in bed together. Kyle reveals that they are now married. When interviewed, Gloria insists that nothing happened between them until Kyle was 17, so she has done nothing illegal. The result of their marriage is that neither can now testify against each other because of spousal privilege.Kyle's bail is revoked because he fled the jurisdiction, if only briefly. Cabot finds that the marriage is valid under Virginia state law, where a minor can marry with the permission of a guardian, even if that guardian is the person they are going to marry.Outside the court there are many reporters who have caught onto the story and want a comment, and one asks a question about Gloria's pregnancy. Stabler and Benson drag him aside to ask about the pregnancy (which they didn't know about) and the reporter reveals that Gloria is three months pregnant and took Kyle with her to the doctor's appointment. Benson and Stabler tell Gloria that they need a paternity test, and she says that she will have her lawyer arrange it. The test shows that neither Kyle nor Lawrence are the father. Benson receives a call and is told that Gloria is in the hospital and is claiming that she was raped. She says that it was Frank Barbarosa, her former lover, whom she says admitted to killing Lawrence out of spite and who threatened to do the same to her. Barbarosa is arrested and they find out that he is a personal trainer and had a one hour session with a client in the Fuller's apartment building, however there is an extra half and hour which he spent in the building after the session was over. He denies that he had anything to do with Lawrence's death.The detectives look into his phone records and find that someone called Barbarosa at the time of the murder from the deli across the street. The deli owner confirms that Gloria was in the deli that night and made two calls from the payphone. Meanwhile, the lab technician tells Benson and Stabler that the sperm in Gloria's rape kit is Barbarosa's, but must have been frozen, because the tails are broken. They realize that Gloria faked the rape.Barbarosa wants to implicate Gloria, for a deal, and he admits that he killed Lawrence Fuller. He says that Gloria gave him the security code for the apartment and told him to use the baseball bat to set up Kyle, but he cannot offer any corroborated proof that would really implicate Gloria.The detectives figure out that the second call which Gloria made from the deli must have been to Kyle, telling him to get out of the apartment. They realize that Kyle is willing to take the fall in order to protect Gloria, and that if he goes free from jail, his life may be in danger because, as his wife, Gloria has access to the money in his trust, and might decide she no longer needs him for anything and kill him too.Benson and Stabler visit Kyle in jail and try to convince him that Gloria is setting him up. He is finally convinced when he finds out that the baby is Barbarosa's, not his, and that they are not going to live happily ever after as Gloria promised. Kyle says that Gloria called him the night of the murder, and told him she'd take care of everything.Benson and Stabler catch up with Gloria outside a family planning clinic, as she is intending to abort her pregnancy. Kyle steps out of their car to confront Gloria and to tell her that he doesn't believe her lies anymore and will testify that she abused him and that she was involved in his father's murder. He hands her divorce papers, and the detectives arrest her. Vessa289"

      "corpus": "During a police raid in a men's club, one of the girls claims a men tried to rape her and insists to press charges, so the SVU is called to the scene. When Olivia and Elliot arrive at the local, another girl raped and strangled is found dead in the club's bathroom. At the precinct, the police make Lisa Perez, the girl that was almost raped at the club, look at line ups with the men arrested at the club to try to identify the one that tried to rape her, but she says the man was gone before the police arrived. Lisa tells Olivia that Sister Peg warned the prostitutes about a guy that was choking working girls. Elliot and Olivia talk to Sister Peg and ask her how she knew about the man strangling hookers, she says it was one of the girls that told her, she keeps a black book with all the bad \"Johns\", so she can warn all the girls. Some time later, another body with the same M.O. is found, Dr. Warner rides in with Fin and Munch to the scene, and they find a thumb print in the victim's forehead. The print is match to Shawn Becker, a recently paroled man convicted of assault and rape, Capt. Craigen asks Olivia and Elliot to give his mug shot to all the working girls. They ask Sister Peg to tell them where the girls that saw him lately are working and she gives them their usual spot. When they arrive at the hotel, the doorman says he just called the police about shots fired in one of the rooms, the detectives show him a picture of the suspect and the doorman confirms he is in the room where the shots came from. Olivia and Elliot go I the room and find a hooker with a gun in her hands and Shawn Becker dead on the floor, she says she shot him. The woman claims she didn't intended to kill the guy; she just wanted him to stop. At the hospital, Olivia asks Deborah what happened, she says she was at a bar looking for a \"john\" and Shawn approached her. She claims that when they arrived at the hotel room and she wanted to discuss the price, he started hitting her and after he raped her, she found his gun and pulled the trigger. At the lab, the bullet from Shawn is a match to another homicide, the only problem being that Shawn, who supposedly owned the gun, was in jail at the time of the murder. The police suspects Deborah owned the gun all along and is responsible for the other murder as well, and that she lied to them when she said the gun belonged to Shawn. Capt. Craigen tells the guys to investigate the first murder and try to find a connection between Deborah and the murder victim. Munch receives a call from the hospital saying that Deborah took off after talking to the police, and that the name and address she gave were fake.Munch and Finn manage to trace a call fake Deborah made at the hospital before disappearing; it is a call to a day care center for children. They go there and ask the manager about the call and get Deborah's real name, Margaret Peterson. Olivia and Benson find a series of unsolved homicides that fit Maggie's pattern: she lures them to her room posing as a prostitute and then kills them and steals their credit cards. Another man's body is found and one of his credit cards is missing, they track down the last charges in it and find Maggie in a hotel with her little son. Elliot arrests her and they call social services to take the child. Dr. Huang asks to talk to Maggie before they interview her and thinks she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, and that she is saying whatever she thinks he want to hear.  Elliot goes to interview her and she starts hitting on him, unbuttoning her blouse. Dr. Huang says she has a \"cocktail\" personality; she reads people and adapts her manners accordingly. The next to interview her is Olivia, who Maggie tries to attack when confronted with the truth, showing her true colors. Alex decides to go for the capital punishment, death penalty, but it is a tough battle since no woman has ever been sentenced to death by a New York court. The judge denies the DA's request to seek the death penalty on Maggie's case, so Alex can do is try to convict Maggie to life without parole. At the trial, the defense tries to make it seem like Maggie killed all those men in self defense because they all raped her. Looking for a way to secure a conviction, Olivia stumbles into Maggie's medical records from the time she was supposed to be eight months pregnant with her son, but the records show no sign of her being pregnant at that time, so they do a DNA comparison and it shows Joey is not Maggie's biological son. Alex finds out that Joey's real mother was killed 18 months before, she confronts Maggie with the facts and offers her a deal, she says she wants to think about it and Alex gives her till the next morning to make her mind. The next day in court, they receive a call saying Maggie killed herself with her pantyhose."
